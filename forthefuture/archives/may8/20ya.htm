<p align="center"><b><i>April 24th, 2020</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Today's the day. Analog controls are here. Plus some QoL fixes. Happy 20th birthday, Christmas 0.94!</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>March 24th, 2020</i></b></p>
<p align="center">I want to fly high! Oh, sorry, Tails was added into SRB2 today, 20 years ago, anyway. I've been looking forward to this! Happy 20th birthday, Christmas 0.93!</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>February 24th, 2020</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Well, here we are. The version that added the homing attack. Happy 20th birthday, Christmas 0.92!</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>December 24th, 2019</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Today, 20 years ago, Sonic Robo Blast 2 Christmas v0.90 released 
  to the public, although it was quickly retracted due to major bugs.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>October 31st, 2019</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Today is Halloween, and you SRB2 fanatics know what this is! 
  Why it is Sonic Robo Blast 2 Halloween v1.0! This was literally DooM with Sonic, 
  and being able to jump. Little to nothing had actually changed as about 40 days 
  worth of development on the source modification had actually taken place.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>September 5th, 2019</i></b></p>
<p align="center">So begins the White Glove Diaries. These ran for a good while, 
  actually.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>December 24th, 2018</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Look out! The TGF engine strikes back! Haha. Jokes aside, Sonic 
  Xmas Blast, or better known as SRB1 Christmas released 20 years ago today.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>September 2nd, 2018</i></b></p>
<p align="center">20 years ago today, the DOS tech test was compiled, at the latest. 
  This was a horribly-failed attempt to revive SRB2 development after development 
  on the TGF version was cancelled in July. Needless to say, Stealth ended up 
  going AWOL.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>July 2018</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Today, or whenever this month, 20 years ago, SRB2 TGF development 
  was cancelled due to the limitations with TGF's tools.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>May 2018</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Today marks the 20th anniversary of Sonic Team Junior's formation.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>April 2018</i></b></p>
<p align="center">This is the apparent date, 20 years ago albeit, that SRB2 TGF's 
  only surviving build was compiled on.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>March 9th, 2018</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Happy 20th anniversary, SRB2! A game's development through 20 
  years is no easy task to comprehend, let alone get through.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>February 11th, 2018</i></b></p>
<p align="center">So, here's the release date of Sonic Robo Blast v1.3f. Holy 
  hell has it been a long time coming up to this point.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>September 7th, 2017</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Woo! Sonic Robo Blast 1.1a is 20 years old now! This was the 
  alpha version that had 7 zones.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>July 4th, 2017</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Here we are. The first release of Sonic Robo Blast 1. This is 
  the demo version, also known as 1.0b. It only has 3 zones.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>May 2017</i></b></p>
<p align="center">Welcome everyone to SRB20YA! We so begin with the 20th anniversary 
  of the beginning of Sonic Robo Blast 1's development!</p>
