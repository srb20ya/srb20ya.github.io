        <BR> It all began back in May 1997 when Johnny 'Sonikku' Wallbank had
        an idea, he wanted to make a Sonic fan-game. At this time, Sonic
        fan-games were relatively rare around the Internet, in comparison to
        today, where you can download hundreds of fan games.<BR> <BR> So,
        loading up Klik &amp; Play, Sonikku sat down at work, and for the next 9
        months, worked on 'Sonic Robo Blast'. The largest Sonic game to date
        ever made in Klik &amp; Play, with two hours worth of levels to fight
        your way through.<BR> <BR> After releasing the final game in February
        1998, Sonikku took a month off and started planning work on Sonic Robo
        Blast 2 (SRB2). In May 1998, Sonic Team Junior was formed, with the
        first two members, Sonikku and David Bulmer working on two projects:
        SRB2 and Sonic Quest (the latter of which is now re-named to 'Sonic:
        Emerald Quest RPG'.<BR> <BR> Soon, people were sending designs and
        graphics to join - giving us the team today. Sonic Robo Blast 2
        underwent several engine changes, from an enhanced SRB1 engine, to a new
        'Games Factory' engine, to C and finally to 3D.<BR> <BR> <U><I><B>Future
        Projects.</B></I></U><BR> <BR> We're not giving up after SRB2 - we've
        got an RPG in line, which is already in planning stages. We hope to
        release single and multi-player addons for Sonic Robo Blast 2, with new
        levels, patches, 'skins' and other goodies to keep SRB2 going long after
        it's released.<BR> <BR> Beyond that... well... who knows?<BR> </TD>
