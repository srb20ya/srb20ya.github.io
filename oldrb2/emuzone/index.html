	<!-- UPDATE Text -->

After almost 2 years of being hosted at EmulationZone.Org, we would like to announce that STJr will no longer be hosted here. We will be moving to <A HREF="http://www.srb2.org"> www.srb2.org</A> within the next few days - or sooner.<BR>
<BR>
We moved to EmulationZone.Org back in September 1999, after our previous host, Segasonic.Net had been having uptime difficulties. We've been hosted under EmulationZone and the Sonic Stuff Research Group ever since, and this marks the end of two years of being under their wings.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Oh no! You're moving! This is the end of STJr!</B> Calm down - this is <B> NOT </B> the end of STJr. We are simply relocating - not retiring.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Why is STJr moving?</B> - Recently, ZDNet (who, in turn, host Emulationzone) has been suffering from financial difficulties, and has thus imposed bandwidth caps - this means speeds can sometimes slow down to a crawl - the future also looks slightly uncertain. Therefore, we considered it wiser to move again.<BR>
<B>Where will you be going?</B> - We will now be hosted by a T3 - the advantage of this is that there will be no bandwidth caps and speed restrictions - on top of this, you can wave goodbye to those pop-up ads you see.<BR>
<BR>
<B><A HREF="http://www.srb2.org">Srb2.org</A> used to be hosted by SSNTails.Org - that's recently gone down. What impact will this have on srb2.org? </B> - None whatsoever.
<BR>
Also, we will be making our usual appearance at SAGE on the 9th - with the release of <B> Sonic Robo Blast II - Demo 4 </B> - for more information, check out (assuming all goes well) <A HREF="http://www.sagexpo.org"> www.sagexpo.org </A>.<BR>
<BR>
In closing, I'd like to thank Andy Wolan, maintainer of <A HREF="http://www.emulationzone.org"> EmulationZone.Org </A> and Damian 'Saxman' Grove, maintainer of the <A HREF="http://ssrg.emulationzone.org"> Sonic Stuff Research Group </A> for their outstanding support while we've been here. Andy and I made one last goodbye present - the <A HREF="http://www.emulationzone.org/ssrg_theme.zip"> SSRG Theme Tune! </A> Enjoy, and hope to see you at our new location!</P>
