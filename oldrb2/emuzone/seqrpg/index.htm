        <I>STATUS: In planning stages.</I><BR> <BR> <B><I><U>Previews.</U></I></B><BR>
        <BR> We've now decided to branch the previews off into lots of smaller
        sections, so you can access them quickly and easily.<BR><BR><B><U>STORY</U></B><BR><BR><B><I><U>The
        Explosion that changed the world...</U></I></B><BR><BR> <I>'Sonic and
        Tails begin are taking a well earnt break - Eggman is dead, and the
        EggRock, as well as the rest of Eggman's evil machines are gone, all
        that's left is one of Eggman's old abandoned factories. Tails catches up
        with Sonic, doing his regular run.</I><BR> <BR> <I>&quot;Sonic...
        wait up!&quot; Tails said, out of breath as Sonic skidded to a halt.</I><BR>
        <I>&quot;What's up?&quot; Sonic said.</I><BR> <I>&quot;Something's
        going on, the computers in the Green Hill labaratory are...&quot;</I><BR>
        <I>&quot;Chill out! Eggman's been dead for years, there's no reason why
        he should be alive and today should be any diff-&quot; He was cut off by
        a loud explosion and seven bright lights went flying into the air. Sonic
        got up and looked around, Tails shook his head and got up.</I><BR> <I>&quot;That's
        what I was trying to tell you, Sonic... the Green Hill Laboratory had
        said they found unusually high energy levels slowly rising from the
        ground. There must be something left where that explosion was. We'd
        better hurry up and look around to see what it might have been... Sonic!
        Let's...&quot; he looked up, and Sonic was no longer there. &quot;Go...?&quot;</I><BR>
        <BR><I>Eggman is still alive. What's he up to? What's he planning
        next?</I><BR><BR><I></I><B><I><U>Friends or Foes?</U></I></B><BR><BR>
        Eggman isn't the only one to be worrying about, while he's up to
        something, he's enlisted the help of the fanatical Dark Mobians... or
        are they too crazy for his own good?<BR><BR>The Dark Mobians were an
        underground movement believed to have been destroyed in a war many years
        earlier, in fact, in turns out that they simply hid away and continued
        breeding, but have they mended their ways since then? What are their
        dark beliefs and rituals leading to? Better or worse?<BR><B></B><BR><U><I><B>Assault
        on the Floating Island.</B></I></U><BR><BR>Knuckles also has a war to
        fight. He found some of Eggman's robots patrolling the Floating
        Island... what were they doing there if Eggman was 'dead'? Knuckles
        decides there's only way to find out, and he glides down to Mobius to
        find out what's going on... the three meet up and enter the factory.<BR><BR><U><B>PLAY
        INFORMATION.</B></U><BR><BR>S:EQ-RPG will have plenty of new features
        to keep you interested...<BR><BR><U><I><B>Parallel quests.</B></I></U><BR><BR>After
        the introduction, you can choose who you want to play as - Each of the
        three characters will have different quests, characters and secrets. You
        can't just play as one character alone to understand the entire story...
        like Sonic Adventure, the three stories will run in parallel... with one
        important difference - depending on what you do in the game, you will
        change how the others will play... for example:<BR><BR>Sonic finds
        three doors in Eggman's factory, and chooses the left one... when you go
        there later as Tails, the left one will be locked out, and if Tails
        chooses the middle door, Knuckles has no choice when he gets there, to
        go through the door on the right. This is just a simple example - you
        can change whole sections of the plot by what you do in another quest!<BR><BR><U><I><B>Segasonic?</B></I></U><BR><BR>Will
        the game be SegaSonic based? Archie based? Fleetway, even? The story is
        set several years after the events of SRB2, but there are lots of
        Segasonic names and locations. Green Hill Village will be your first
        stop, although Sonic and co will venture into darker areas, such as the
        Graveyard, and a huge mountain converted into a base by the Dark
        Mobians, and even venture into alternate dimensions and times! You can
        expect to see Amy, Mighty and Ray all as playable characters, along with
        a few new characters, such as Xavier and Rueben.<BR><BR><B><I><U>What
        about swords / shields, etc?</U></I></B><BR><B><I><U></U></I></B><BR>It
        would be somewhat out of place to have Sonic fighting off legions of
        robots with a katana, and defending himself with a huge iron shield. You
        can expect Sonic and Tails to spin-attack foes, while Knuckles is used
        to fighting with his fists. Amy will be able to use a variety of
        hammers. However, one of the characters will be able to use a sword, so
        for the Final Fantasy players in you, you won't be too left out!<BR><BR><U><I><B>Chaos
        Powers.</B></I></U><BR><BR>Each character will be able to use some
        Chaos Powers, however, the range of powers you can use depends on the
        characters you have. Xavier, for example, is great with physical
        attacks, but can only use a few weak healing Chaos Powers. Amy, on the
        other hand relies more on her Chaos Powers to defeat enemies than her
        hammer attacks. To keep the characters having a balanced selection of
        Chaos Powers, we have decided not to use any of the 'Every character can
        have magic' system as seen in most RPGs nowadays.<BR><BR><U><I><B>Battle
        engine.</B></I></U><BR><BR>Some say that Sonic should stick to be
        being solely a platformer, and some would like to see some of the
        elements from the 'Final Fantasy' games in an RPG. We've decided to
        satisfy both of these with an entirely new and unique battle engine.<BR><BR>*
        The game will not feature random battles, and you can avoid some battles
        by remaining out of an enemies' line of sight, though of course, the
        more battles you enter, the more experience you'll obtain.<BR>* Like
        most RPGs, you will be given a turn gauge.<BR>* With one revoloution of
        the gauge, you will be able to hit enemies with a physical attack, if
        you wait another half-a-revoloution or more, you have an increased
        chance of a critical hit.<BR>* With two revoloutions of this gauge, you
        will be able to attacks with a Chaos Power, the equivilant of magic.<BR>*
        With three revoloutions of this gauge, you can use a combination of
        these attacks (e.g, a Chaos Power and a physical attack, or three
        physical attacks, etc.) or a 'Special' attack, which, in exchange for
        some a few CP, will allow you to use a selection of special attacks, and
        more are added as you gain levels.<BR>* In addition to all, this you
        will be able to move around the battlefield, and take advantage of all
        the terrain, if you're on a hill, your attacks will do more advantage on
        an enemy lower down, if however, you're swimming around in water, you'll
        be at a disadvantage.<BR>* You will have to actually move close to
        enemies to inflict physical damage, rather than fling a little sword
        (e.g, Final Fantasy 4, 5 and 6) into mid air, and they will have to do
        vice-versa, however, while moving around, your gauge will charge far
        more slowly.<BR>* You don't have to make a move like the early Final
        Fantasy games, you can pass turns and let someone charge up a powerful
        gauge attack, or let them hide until they recover health - all of which
        will add to the statergic value for the more stratergy orientated fans.<BR>*
        Also, you'll be able to physically dodge some projectile attacks, if
        you're quick enough! Some might be homing attacks or too quick, but if
        you're quick enough, you might be able to dodge some attacks, avoiding
        damage entirely, also, the enemies will be able to do vice-versa, so be
        careful when you hurl that fireball at them!<BR>* Most of the
        characters will have special movement properties. Sonic has his
        supersonic speed, to run around some of the battlefields with minimal
        worry about gauge loss. Tails and Xavier will be able to fly, allowing
        them to reach higher vantage points, but this will make them more
        vulnerable to projectile attacks. Knuckles can dig and surprise enemies,
        while hiding from some physical attacks, but if there's an earthquake,
        or burrow into some lava / water, you'll be flushed out, and recieve
        extra damage, Amy can use Hammer Jump to get to some unreachable areas.<BR><BR>As
        you can see, we really have tried to cater for the best of both worlds.<BR><BR><B><U>CHARACTER
        PROFILES:</U></B><BR><BR>Along the way, you'll encounter many
        friends... and many foes. Some might react better on how you talk to
        them, here's a run-down on some of the main characters you'll see in the
        game.<BR><BR><B><I><U>The three major characters...</U></I></B><BR><BR><B></B><BR><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>SONIC
        THE HEDGEHOG.</B></FONT><BR><BR>The blue hedgehog returns, with all
        his speed and skill intact, with news of Dr. Eggman's ressurection, or
        rather... lucky survival, he will do anything to defeat his arch-enemy
        once and for all. Little does he, or the rest of the world know what he
        has in store for the planet.<BR><BR><I><B>Weapon: </B></I>Shoes /

        Sonic that he is just as good as him, he follows Sonic intially as a
        sidekick, however, as he gets drawn deeper and deeper into the story, he

        THE ECHIDNA.</FONT></B><BR><BR>Knuckles, as always, cares little for
        the rest of the world, unless it puts Angel Island in danger! Once a
        patrol of robots lands on his island, Eggman is quickly suspected and
        turned into his number one enemy. However, as with the others, the
        adventure appears not to just save Angel Island from destruction, but
        the entire world.<BR><BR><I><B>Weapon: </B></I>Gloves.<BR><I><B>Special

        Tails and Knuckles are not alone, they have friends and allies along the
        way, willing to help them, some will join voluntarily and without
        hesistataion, others might be hidden or require persuasion. We'll leave
        it for you to find out.<BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#FF80C0"><B>AMY ROSE.</B></FONT><BR><FONT COLOR="#FF80C0"></FONT><BR><FONT COLOR="#FF80C0"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Amy

        admit it on the outside, Sonic does at least consider Amy as a good

        her sights on Sonic, she's happy!</FONT></FONT><BR><FONT COLOR="#FF80C0"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"></FONT></FONT><BR><FONT COLOR="#FF80C0"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><I><B>Weapon:
