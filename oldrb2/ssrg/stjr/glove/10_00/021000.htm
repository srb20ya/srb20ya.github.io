<p><font FACE="Verdana">Hi, A.J. here! Wow, I can't remember the last time I did one of
these!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Sonikku wanted me to talk about the sprites, so here I go...</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I've been doing Sonic's sprite for a little over a year now, and
Tails since February. I'm not even TOUCHING Knuckles until I'm done with these two...
luckily, not much is left for Sonic.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">SRB2's sprites are done much like the &quot;Earthworm Jim
Method&quot;. Draw, scan in, color, and resample. This gives you a very nice-looking
sprite at a low resolution. The best way to learn how to draw your subject is get some
good pictures of different angles, or even better yet, instructional model sheets, such as
the ones found <a href="http://www.segasonic.net/tails/sheets/">here</a>. Another handy
utility is a circle stencil with different sizes, which helps draw the circles perfectly:</font></p>

alt="It takes me at least 15 minutes to do this, possibly longer. It's not a quick process."></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">First use an HB pencil on tracing paper (or pegged animation
paper, if you're lucky). This way you can erase any mistakes you make, and also see the
previous frame behind it.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">After you think you've got it right, get a sheet of white paper
(typing/copy paper will do) and a pen (NOT ball-point!) and get to work tracing! Using a
lightboard is preferable, unless you like drawing against a window.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="021000_2.gif" width="384" height="384" alt="Penned!"></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Next, it's scan time! I scan my images in at a puny 100dpi, but
that is more than enough.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="021000_3.gif" width="384" height="384"
alt="Ooh! Pretty colors!"></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Color them! Make sure you get your colors right. Nothing hurts an
image more if you don't have the proper colors. If you don't know how to do shading, get
someone to do it for you. (Photoshop is for wussies!)</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="021000_4.gif" width="384" height="384" alt="Before resampling"><img
src="021000_5.gif" width="70" height="70" alt="After resampling!"></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Then, resample. Make sure you surround the sprite with it's
darkest shade used in the image. (See picture).</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="021000_6.gif" width="70" height="70"
alt="Add Cyan for the transparent color..."><img src="021000_7.gif" width="70" height="70"
alt="Greenerize! (So you can change the color)"></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I resample my pictures from 384x384 down to 70x70 to get the
proper size. Next you have to remove all the excess around the image.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="021000_8.gif" width="128" height="190" alt="Super Sonic!"><img
src="021000_9.gif" width="384" height="384" alt="Original Animation (no bounce)"><img

<p><font FACE="Verdana">And of course, you animate it. ;)</font></p>
