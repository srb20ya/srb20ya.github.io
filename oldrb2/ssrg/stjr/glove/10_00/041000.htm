<p><font FACE="Verdana">It's the battle of the century!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Well, after going through several message boards and trudging my way through several 'I hate the DC!', 'I hate the PS2!' 'Microsoft sux' messages on several message boards, I thought I'd write up a little summary I thought up as to my opinions on the four consoles, but brace yourself: This a pretty long WGD...</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana"><b>Sega: The Dreamcast</b> - In this 'generation' of console wars, the DC is technically, the most inferior machine (though some people would like to put it against the PS2, and most of the game demos are really not much different from the Dreamcast's power), but it's a lot easier to develop games for a Dreamcast than a Playstation 2. So far so good, but Sega have still managed to make a few mess-ups here and there: </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Firstly, in Europe and Japan, the DC is getting a good pounding. Sales for it are pretty bleak, and with Europe refusing (once again) to advertise the DC's games, it's now been cut down to magazine adverts. Uh oh. Because of this, most of the major developers have jumped ship to the PS2 and the X-Box. More on these later, but that can't be good for Sega.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">One of the other reasons I bought a Dreamcast was to get nifty PC games that wouldn't run on my (then old and wrinkled) PC. When the first few PC -> DC games came out, they were at £39.99 in major retail stores. Full price. "New console, fair enough" I thought. Several years later and these prices aren't going down, and most people buy the PC version for £29.99 or so. Oh yes, and the PC versions can usually produce higher resoloutions - oh: And the DC versions come out a month or two (or worse in some cases) later. I'm not sure what this in like in America, but that's not a good deal. Thanks Sega. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">However, the Dreamcast is doing nicely in the US, and with more games with online support to come, maybe Sega can really show off what they're made of. Please, please, please, PLEASE don't screw up the online games when they hit our shores, Sega of Europe, and then say 'We're not ready!' when J.F Cecilion has been bleating on about how great online gaming will be. Please get it right. I don't want to have to kill you. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana"><b>Sony: The Playstation 2</b> Sony - you have messed up badly. Firstly, in America, the number of consoles to be released has been slashed down to 500,000, with rumours of a delay until Christmas. Ouch. Things in Europe aren't much better. Sony introduced a pre-order system that was a total shambles. People were confused about whether you could actually buy one in the shops, then there was a mess up with the date, ending up being pushed back to November and there hasn't been any hype for the PS2 in Europe at all. When I read that the PS2 could be available for pre-order now, I was taken by surprise.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Next on the list of complaints is the price: £299. That may include a DVD player, but doesn't the Dreamcast have a modem that lets you get around the Internet? At £149? Plus, don't expect to be wowed by the DVD capabilities: DJ Mike gave me a vast, lengthy talk on cheap DVD players. While I can't really care less if there's a tiny blotch of bad compression or whatever in the corner as I don't even notice it, random stopping and starting IS noticable and boy, it's really annoying. My PC's DVD drive does this, and according to many people, so does the PS2's. Whoops. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Also, while Sony has a large game line up, most of isn't particually great. Official F1 Driving Game, Generic Official Turbo F1 Driving Game 2K, Oh Look Another F1 Driving Game and Tekken Tag Tournament doesn't really get me too excited. Besides, Monaco Grand Prix on the Megadrive/Genesis was hilarious, and I don't need another Grand Prix game, thanks.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Now the bad stuff is out of the way, I'll mention the good things about the PS2. Several games companies are backing it, and with a continuation in the Final Fantasy and Metal Gear series, that DOES get my attention, although I'm not looking forward to a continuation in the Tomb Raider saga, and the 'all-brand spanking new' FIFA games, thanks. The price will come down (despite Sony Europe announcing the price cut would be before Winter, which is sure to harm sales) and, hoping that the DVD problems are ironed out, it does let you watch DVDs.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana"><b>Nintendo: The GameCube</b> I'll get on to the GBA in a minute, so far I'm geting pretty excited about the GameCube, true, it looks about as attractive as a house brick, but it's the inside that counts. The GameCube is focused PURELY on games. This is something I've been longing to see for a while now. The lack of modem and DVD player (at least, that's the way things are looking right now) means the price should be pretty low.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Wait though - the Game Cube is rumoured to come out in Late 2001 / Early 2002. That's too long for most punters to wait, who will have got their hands on a PS2 or X-Box, that and major game developers aren't touching the Game Cube. But Nintendo always value quality over quanity - this a really good thing, reminding me of the days before the Playstation 1 killed off originality...</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">On the other hand, Pokemon will only keep Nintendo alive for so long, the N64 has survived so long because of a combination of Pokemon and good advertising. But eventually, even the most irritating 7-11 year old will tire of Pokemon and want something new / get the latest craze. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">But that's not all from Nintendo's yard...</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana"><b>Nintendo: The Game Boy Advance</b> - I am really looking forward to this one. Sporting backwards compatability with the Game Boy, 16-bit capabilities and several good games already announced, Nintendo is on to an instant winner.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">However, it's a little early to tell if the GBA will do well. Nothing much has been said about the price, release dates or any other games due to be released. Hopefully this will be cleared up sooner or later.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">What really excites me about this though is the comeback of 2D games. If you can imagine the Megaman X series or Super Mario World or Final Fantasy appearing on this small handheld, as well as updates to the series and the introduction of many, new titles for the system, it's pretty easy to see why.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">If Nintendo play their cards right, they're going to be on to something big here...</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">And finally... <b> Microsoft: The X-Box (Xbox)</b> I'm not sure if Microsoft have decided whether to call it 'X-Box', 'X Box' or 'Xbox', but in any case, 'X' and 'Box' should feature somewhere in the final name.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">However, it seems that the game publishers like the (slightly unrealstic-sounding) specs and you can expect to see Generic F1 Game continue here! Hurray! Along with the Tomb Raider saga. Wow!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I, for one, can't understand why so many games publishers and developers are leaping onto the X-Box boat, considering the Captain hasn't said much about the hull. Will it be made of rotten wood or made of RealHardSuperLightSteel (RHSLS) (tm). According to the specs, we have the RHSLS alright, but I don't really want to have any console full of generic, and frankly, unoriginal game releases. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Nothing much has been said about the price or release dates again. And how many people are going to trust Microsoft? We've all seen what happened to the computer industry and for a more accurate test, try doing stuff on your PC. The more memory consuming, the better (several copies of Adobe Photoshop and Word '97 are good examples). When you've done that and rebooted thanks to Mr. Blue Screen, come back here.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Done that? Good. Imagine if that happened to games and each week resulted in you having to get X-Box v2.424.210 and eventually X-Box Second Edition. That's really not good. Heck, you can even cause some Dreamcast games to come out with an illegal operation, that's not a good sign for Microsoft. However, this is only a view from what's been going on with the PC industry. Can Gates and the Microsoft crew dominate the video game market (properly), without having to rely on people constnatly updating?</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Who will win? Who will lose? Who will be the #1 console in people's hearts? Do I actually care about this, so long as the good games are produced? Only time will tell!!</font></p>
