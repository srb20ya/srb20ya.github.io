<p><font FACE="Verdana">Long time no see, folks. Time for a quick editorial on the recent Sega crisis.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">The basic point I'll be stressing here is that Sega make great games. They just suck when it comes down to running a business. Personally, I think the fact that they are developing games for other consoles is a very good thing. Yes, even the Playstation2, for all you PS2-haters reading this. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">For those of you wondering how this could possibly be a good thing - this is why: If Sonic were to continue being Sega only, he'd die pretty quickly after this announcement. In the same way, if Square had continued to release the 'Final Fantasy' on the Nintendo 64, the series may well have had a 'Final' Fantasy. Personally, I can't wait to play the all-new Sonic game when it comes out for the Game Boy Advance. Heck, it gives me a good reason to buy more consoles - Sega's games are always top-notch.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">OK, so Sega may not be the best at hardware development, with a long list of faults (including the Mega CD, Saturn and now it seems, the Dreamcast) but they've on the whole, released great games for these systems (e.g: Sonic CD, Panzer Dragoon Saga and Shenmue respectively - the list go on for pages and pages). Perhaps now, Sega have finally gotten their act together.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">As for the Sega / Pace deal, I'm not so sure if this will work as Sega should be concentrating more on software now than hardware, having made their decision.</font></p>
