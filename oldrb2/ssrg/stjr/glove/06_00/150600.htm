<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Updated
and maintained by Johnny 'Sonikku' Wallbank and A.J Freda.</span></p>

<p><b><i><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:red'>15th

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:red'>ChuChu Rocket –
Thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>ChuChu Rocket has finally arrived in
Europe, and it’s rather good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Admittedly, for a single player, the game
has a limited life-span, the 100 puzzles shouldn’t take you too long to
complete (save a few of the Mania ones) and the Stage Challenge is easy enough
once you have two players or when you finally master the technique of joy-pad
swapping, and the 4P battle against the computer ranges a little too wildly from
the computer being utterly moronic (‘Weak’) to being an outright cheat (‘Tough’
– yeah, I’m sure you can move your cursor across the screen in about one second…
riigggghttt…), with very little in the middle. But then again – like the
excellent Bomberman / DynaBlaster series, it isn’t the single player mode that
makes it special.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Have some friends round and ChuChu Rocket
becomes a lot more fun – especially if you’re playing against an evenly-skilled
opponent. Unfortunately, the people in your neighbourhood might be relatively
bad at playing ChuChu Rocket or videogames in general – what then? Go online.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>This is where ChuChu really shines. I had
my doubts about the online play feature at first – I was expecting horrendous
lag, idiots with the maturity of someone in kindergarten (“u suk ur *** huhu”),
Sega of Europe to mess up, and a million other woes. I’ve only ever really had
fun playing an online game with Quake and Worms Armageddon – the first of which
was good until it was phased out by Quake II, the latter of which was good
until you find the servers reek with said idiots, and I was expecting this to
be the third one – how wrong I was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Granted – the access time between the
servers / game rooms can be a little annoying. On a bad day you can find
yourself being stuck for a minute, or even be disconnected – though Sega of
Europe have been fixing this. Another thing I found to be very strange is how
the game doesn’t hide your password at the start, though only sad, strange people
will bother looking through the window to your room and write down your password
and imitate you, it’s a little unsettling when it’s displayed on the screen for
a good ten seconds at worst.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Onto the game rooms – As soon as I got
here, I was almost counting how long it’d be before two gamers would yell
across to each other with a string of censored out swearing. It didn’t happen,
and better still, you can choose not to be subjected to this rubbish if it does
happen by pressing the ‘Y’ button, which will open/close the chat window, this
though doesn’t stop anyone from ‘whispering’ to you, but it’s nice not to have
to enter a game room and hear “buttwhipper2_K” and “wikkiddood” fighting
between each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I created a game room and someone soon
hopped in, I waited for any other players to join but I didn’t get the chance –
after a short 12 second pause, the other guy started a game, which made me
wonder why the heck the Sonic Team didn’t decide to put a ‘Ready’ button in, so
that everyone would have to say they were ready before starting a game. On the
other hand, this can lead people / game hosts to waste time and never start the
game up, but then people would just leave the room. Here – if one person wants to
start, everyone else must.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The lack of lag is impressive. While at
first it might be annoying, you soon get used to having to think ahead and plan
a route out – and can actually give you a chance to think. But then this leads
to a few more gripes – The Computer. There is no way to disable the option of
having / not having a computer player. Not only can they move their cursor around
at a far faster speed than a human player can, it seems that they are
unaffected by lag. And when you do get lag, it can be pretty nasty… for
example: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Mouse Mania! You plan out a nice route to
your rocket for the ChuChu’s to follow, but find yourself just sitting back and
waiting for the arrows to pop up, but by then it’s too late – the Computer has
got it, or a lucky human player has had arrows laid to his rocket and is
getting a ton of mice. Your route finally gets laid down at this point, which
leads to someone getting a pink mouse… Cat Mania! You now have a nice route to
your rocket for the cats to follow. You bash the A/B/X/Y buttons in a desperate
attempt to get them away from your lovely stock of mice – it’s too late. “Ouch!
–120!”, “Ouch! –80!”, “Ouch! –40!”, and you go from 350 points or so to about
50, and to add insult to injury, some more mice have been repelled from your
anti-cat route and end up heading to the computer’s rocket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Thankfully – if one player gets lag,
everyone else does (except, it seems, for the computer) so everyone is at a
disadvantage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Now for the gameplay – it’s fast and
furious. If you’re not keeping focused on the task at hand, you can end up with
a cat eating away the mice in your rocket, it’s also very enjoyable (save for
the lagged periods) and the taunt machine deserves credit – as a replacement
for anyone typing “LOL U *** *****R! U GOT CAT!” or “**** U! **** OFF WITH UR *****Y
CATS 2 MY ROCKET!” - not that anyone with a typing speed of 80/90 wpm could actually
achieve this as the action is so fast, it replaces it with a taunt machine,
either gloating in victory or taunt at someone winning – while I wish the cycle
speed of the taunt machine can be adjusted, it’s a brilliant way to incite your
opponents into carrying on… or disconnecting in frustration, usually the
former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Speaking of disconnection, there seems to
be a huge annoyance the Sonic Team have overlooked – when people disconnect, it
doesn’t just disconnect them from the network, but it seems to disconnect
everyone. This means some idiots could start a game and then quickly disconnect
– meaning you have to reconnect to the network and waste more money in doing
all of this. Why, oh why, oh WHY didn’t they just return you to the game room
and make the person who disconnected lose the game? I reckon the majority of
people who disconnect are doing so to keep their score intact / because they’re
losing and don’t want to achieve victory / to be annoying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Hopefully, all these minor niggles will be
fixed – either in the form of upgrade discs, or servers improvements, but these
don’t stop it from becoming a good game – nay, a great game. Chalk up another success
to the Sonic Team with it’s first (mostly) multiplayer game!</span></p>
