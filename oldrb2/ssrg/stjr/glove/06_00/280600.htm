<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I’ve always enjoyed playing RPGs – my
first one being ‘Soleil’ (better known as ‘Crusader of Centy’ in the US and
‘Rangacenty’ in Japan) for the Mega Drive (‘Genesis’ for American readers),
while this game was a blatant rip-off of Zelda, it was different and quirky
none the less. The game had brilliant music and was occasionally tricky to
boot. Eventually I found Panzer Dragoon Saga, and it was a slow weekend, I
decided to buy a copy of the Official Saturn Magazine which boasted the whole
of CD 1 as a demo. I must have played this demo about 6 times over at 2 hours a
turn. Wow. I soon picked up the full game as well as other fantastic RPGs such
as Shining Force III. RPGs were moving quickly up my ‘favourite game genre’
list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>However, the RPG market in Europe has
always been frowned upon, and we didn’t see our first Final Fantasy game until
FF7 came out. I had a short go on my friend’s PlayStation who continually
convinced me it was utterly crap, and eventually he turned it off to play Grand
Theft Auto. But – despite what he said, I enjoyed playing it. I eventually got
my hands on a SNES emulator and managed to obtain FF4 and 6. At the time, the
emulator wasn’t all that great – translucencies didn’t work (I had no end of
problems with FF4’s first dungeon – The ‘Mist Cave’ until I was told how to
remove the fog layer which should have been translucent, but instead, made you
unable to see anything.), the sound emulation was a little poor and there was
no high colour support. But I was soon hooked on FF4 and 6.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Soon, I managed to get my hands on Chrono
Trigger, which rivalled Panzer Dragoon Saga – so much so that I managed to get
my characters up to Level 99. The only other game I had done this with was
Panzer Dragoon Saga, and soon I got my hands on a PlayStation with FF7. Pretty
soon after that I picked up Breath of Fire III, Alundra and Grandia. Between
all this, the S:EQ-RPG notes have undergone 2 re-writes. And I’m currently
wondering a little over my third attempt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I have had mixed opinions on all these
RPGs. First I’ll start off with the good ones. <b>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. READ
WITH CAUTION.</b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Panzer Dragoon Saga </span></b><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>– This game is difficult to fault. The game had genuinely
created a whole new world. The graphics (at the time) were jaw-dropping, giving
FF7 a run for its money. The towns were brilliantly created – whereas the FF
games usually had some townspeople saying “Oh no. There is a big war between x
and y! Help me!” and nothing else, Panzer Dragoon Saga had townspeople that
actually cared about what was happening around them, rather than walking around
aimlessly and saying the above, and the characters actually had real speech (in
‘Panzerese’ for lack of better term – something else that helped the game
define it’s own world – and the game made you care about what was happening.
When the Empire attacks Zoah, you genuinely feel at angry at them, and sadness
for the destruction of Zoah. The FF games just made you say “Oops. That nasty
Sephiroth!” or just tried to overwhelm you with depression as every town gets
destroyed by Blab-blah end of world spell. To boot, the game has an outstanding
soundtrack, without a doubt the best seen in any RPG.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Grandia – </span></b><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>This game features the best party development I’ve
seen (Panzer Dragoon Saga doesn’t really have a party to control, just Edge on
his dragon) – with each party member having a distinct personality. Justin
wants to fulfil his ambition of being a great adventurer, Sue is a
motherly-type and tries to stop Justin from making too big a mistake, there’s
the love interest with Feena, Gadwin is a serious ‘no messing around’ type who’s
always aspiring to beat challenges, Rapp – despite the terrible Australian
accent the translators have bestowed him with – is an ill-mannered youth with
his heart in the right place and Guido is a wise, guiding figure. The only
characters who don’t have so much to go on with are Milda and Liete, but they
don’t really join your party for too long. The game manages to pull off key
events very well – when Sue leaves your party she doesn’t die or whatever, she
leaves because if she continues she will be exhausted and doesn’t want to hold
Justin back. The way this was pulled was such that nearly made me cry and when
Justin begins to learn what’s really happening, he realises that he’s not
playing a simply adventuring game, but is part of something much bigger – the fact
he becomes more mature and serious from being so cheerful and optimistic makes
the second half of CD 2 even more dramatic and thrilling and - while perhaps
not so much as Panzer Dragoon Saga does – this game features ‘living’
townspeople.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Chrono Trigger – </span></b><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>Chrono Trigger really doesn’t have so much in the
character development department – your main character doesn’t even speak in
the game (save for one of the hidden endings) and the townspeople, like most
Square games suffer from “I am happy. Woohoo.” / zombified townspeople. So why
is this game good. The soundtrack is the first point, while it’s not quite up
to Panzer Dragoon Saga’s awesome standards, it’s got an excellent soundtrack.
But the real beauty lies behind the gameplay and plot. The first time I played
this, I thought the game was going to be some form of less mature story (as I
did behind Grandia, actually) – and you soon end up being the one saving the
planet from the deadly Lavos. Lavos is a brilliant villain. He doesn’t
continually pop up and taunt you incomprehensively before running off and
saying “Uwehehehe!” or dropping a boss to ‘slow you down’ or whatever – he simply
lies in wait until 1999 A.D when in one quick swoop, the world falls to its
knees. Lavos does meet you prematurely in the game, but this is done very well,
to show you how powerful Lavos is, and what a stupid mistake the people of Zeal
make. The gameplay is first class, whereas Final Fantasy VI requires you to
spend hours levelling up characters that you either love or hate (usually the
latter), you can – on the whole, leave the ones in Chrono Trigger behind and
concentrate on developing a powerful team of your choice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>And now, why I dislike some RPGs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Final Fantasy VI – </span></b><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>Some of you will be thinking “What the hell is
going on?!” and are probably considering closing your browser in disgust. Let
me explain something: I enjoy this game up until the End of the World and even
some elements beyond that, some of the townspeople have more interesting things
to say (but there’s still a large case of zombie townspeople) and the character
development is impressive – save for the fact that they’ve crammed way too many
characters in. I absolutely loved to use Terra, Sabin, Edgar and Locke as my
main party, but I could not stand to use Gau, Strago and Relm. Yet I had to use
everyone in the final dungeon. “But I don’t WANT to use everyone!” I said. “Tough!”
The game replies. “No – Tough to YOU.” I said – I don’t want to spend 3 hours for
each character I hate, levelling them up! One Game Genie code later and I have
everyone at Level 99 with all magic. I hated myself for doing that, but
realised that I’d vaguely have more fun doing this than spending hours and
hours levelling up characters I didn’t want to. This game taught everyone me
two valuable lessons – Play games that have a sensible number of characters,
and playing a game that gives everyone the chance to use ‘Ultima’ is a really,
really dumb idea, which was immediately followed up by FF7 and 8. At least FF5
and 8 had some (vague) constraint at stopping you from doing this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Breath of Fire III – </span></b><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>Boredom isn’t good. This game is BAD. The first few
hours are interesting – you escape from a mine and get found by two youths who
cause trouble, and the game sets out to be interesting. But where is the
character development? I found it hard to find here. The storyline too is
pretty naff. The story has absolutely nothing to do with anything later in the
game. When 10 years pass, Garr suddenly says to you (basically) “Gee! I’m
bored! Let’s find out the answer to life, the universe and everything, that’ll
be fun!” and that last bit he says is horribly, horribly wrong. The battles are
an utter chore, and the game offers very few fun bits. The biggest sin of all
is the Desert of Death. How anyone could let this slip into an RPG is beyond
me. Basically, turn right a little and hold up until you fall asleep. 2 hours
of walking along a very, very similar landscape. Very realistic, yes – Very boring,
yes. At this point, I was seriously considering about not playing this game
again. I breathed out and persuaded myself to continue a little further – the last
dungeon was straight after this after all… the game has a decent enough
soundtrack, despite the fact it sounds like a fairly weedy AWE32 at times. I
paid £20 for this game (about $30?) – I felt like it was worth more like £5. I
pray that these awful mistakes are corrected in BoF IV – After that I won’t
give it another chance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Phew – so there we have it. I’m going to
bear all of this in mind as I continue writing the S:EQ-RPG notes…</span></p>
