    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>UPDATE 6/1/2000: </B>It appears that WADAuthor
      doesn't like the doom2.wad given in SRB2:HT, therefore, you will need to
      also download the real doom2.wad (from 'DooM II') to use the level editor.
      Get it <A HREF="http://stjr.segasonic.net/levels">here</A>... we now
      return you to normal White Glove Diarying (?!?)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Welcome back! That short break should have given
      you time to get Part one done! If you've jumped in at Part 2, and I might
      as well include this a general note - I'm assuming that you're now fairly
      confident with the basic stuff, so we're going to dive back into the deep
      end again, so, unless you've had experience with DooM editing before, and
      want to learn the SRB2 specials, then go back and read Part 1 - you NEED
      to read it, on the same line, if I say: &quot;Create a sector, with a
      ceiling height of 512, a floor height of 0, and then create a platform in
      the middle of that, with a floor height of 128, and check all the below
      textures around the platforms.&quot; and you thought &quot;Dear God...
      what drugs is Sonikku taking?!&quot; then you'd better look back over Part
      1 too.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>STUFF YOU'LL NEED:</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Firstly - you'll need to download
      <A HREF="..\..\download\srb2\srb2ween.zip" TARGET="">SRB2:HT from here</A>,
      and <A HREF="..\..\download\misc\wauthor.zip" TARGET="">WADAuthor from
        here</A>. The last thing you'll need a special srb2.wcf file that's
      included in this .zip, if it didn't make it,
      <A HREF="..\..\download\misc\srb2.wcf" TARGET="">grab it here</A>.
      WADAuthor is the level editor I'll be using to cover this, but if you
      prefer DCK, we'll add a .zip of that in the near future - the techniques
      used are still similar in most cases.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr5_01.wad" TARGET="">STEP 5:</A>
      </B>Let's go swimming! For this step, you'll need that srb2.wcf file I
      mentioned earlier, if you've not got it, scroll up a bit and click on the
      link to get it.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Things are slightly more complex here, firstly, if
      you've deleted your creation for some reason, go back to Part 1, and get
      'Step 4' again, which has the most up-to-date version of our level so far,
      alternatively, if you feel you made such a tragic mess out of your level
      that you cannot live with yourself or something, go back and download it.
      =)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Create a new sector - we'll try something
      different and create a different room, fiddle with the vertexes a bit to
      create a cave-style (semi-random lines) room. Keep it fairly small, but
      enough to get a nice little jump or two around the area. Now, attach
      another sector to the end of that cavern - this will now be reffered to as
      the 'middle' sector, where we'll stick our water, make it a little stream
      or a pond - size doesn't matter... within reason! We want an area big
      enough so Sonic will actually fit into the hole in the ground and get
      drenched, alternatively, we don't want a massive lake 16,000 units long or
      so which will take a good 10 minutes to wade through.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Once you're happy, create a dry land sector after
      that. The finished result DOES NOT have to look like this, I just did this
      as a small demonstration. Keep the floor heights for the two dry land
      sectors at 192, and we'll make the water sector a little deeper at 142.
      We'll also increase the ceiling height to 512. Don't forget to fix the
      textures!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you look in the screenshot, I've got a little
      sector outside all of our 'cavern' sectors. Was that a fit of insanity I
      had? Nope. This little sector will be the 'water-setter' which we'll use
      to set our water height, whether Sonic stands in a puddle or a deep abyss.
      We'll aim for neck height. Set this outside sector any bunch of textures
      and ceiling height - the floor height is important though. This is how
      high our water will be. For neck height, we're looking at around 180. If
      you don't like it, you can change it later.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Here's where that .wcf file I mentioned earlier
      comes in - this will teach you about 'tagging' lines. SRB2 supports all
      the standard DooM 2 features, which we use now and then in the levels,
      (mostly crushers and lifts) however, we've put a few features of our own
      into the engine for us to use. Here's how you can use them!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">In this new sector, select any linedef and double
      click on it to bring up the properties. We've not even so much as given
      the top-left section a glance, so now it's time to do that. In the 'Class'
      section, go down to 'Special' and select 'n: Water' - now in the Sector
      Tag switch in the bottom right, set it to '1'.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Ready for the next bit? Double click on the water
      sector we talked about earlier (the one with a floor height of 142) and
      set the Sector Tag to '1'. Are we noticing a pattern here? You guessed it.
      That linedef in the water-setter does what it says on the tin. That sector
      tag combines the linedef to the sector. Still confused? Try going back to
      the very first room with the two platforms, and set all three of those
      sectors to have a sector tag of 1... behold as Sonic starts underwater!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">(Interesting Note: After doing this, I
      inadvertently discovered an SRB2:HT bug (don't worry... it won't affect
      the final version unless we use fog any of the levels)... after dipping
      into the water, go back to the start (make sure it's dry) - why do you get
      green fog in this sector when you go below the water height?)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr6_01.wad" TARGET="">STEP 6:</A></B>
      We'll go onto the next most common feature, to give you a better idea of
      how linedefs work. Create a corridor going straight on after the water
      section. Again, put a middle sector in, and a continuing one after that.
      Keep the floor height at 192, but make the ceiling heights for this group
      of sectors 342 except for the middle sector, which should be 341. Use 'Bug
      Fix' to sort out the textures for the middle sector. (Which I why I said
      to keep it at 341, not 342!) Done that? Go way back to the start of your
      level. You see that linedef which leads into the tunnel at the start...?
      Here's a pic. to show you what I'm talking about. MS Paint - as I said,
      was still in a very bad mood.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><IMG SRC="tdiag05.gif" ALT="THIS is the line I'm talking about!" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yuck. Your version will obviously look at lot more
      colourful, but that's MS Pants... uh, Paint for you!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now, this line will set off the crusher. You must
      have a linedef set off a crusher, sadly, they don't magically come into
      action on their own 'since the start of the level'. This is the next best
      thing though, as no-one will notice, unless they've got x-ray vision.
      Which they haven't... I hope.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Goto properites and 'Class' - then go down to
      crushing ceiling. You've got several choices you can have here, for now,
      we'll just look at the 'W1L' range - I'll talk about what the 'W1L' bit
      means later. You can select a few choices of crushers, and depending on
      how nasty you are, you can pick the one you'd like to use to kill that
      evil, evil player! (Umm...)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'start fast crush' - This is a quick crusher,
      these will go up and down fairly quickly, meaning you don't get as long to
      stand around underneath them!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'start slow crush' - These a slower crushers, but
      still kill you in one go if you happen to be underneath them.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'start slow crush (silent)' - If you listen
      carefully, before you get to the crusher, you can hear a sound, if you
      want to be really evil, you can use this to set crushers off without any
      noticing the noise, adding to the element of surprise, but, when you can
      see the crusher, it's pretty useless.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Pick one of the above, and set the sector tag to
      <B>2</B> this time. ('1' has already been used by the water, remember?)
      Go to the crusher sector, and set the sector tag to 2. Now run the level
      and behold as you have added your first trap into the level!</FONT></P>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr7_01.wad" TARGET="">STEP 7:</A>
      </B>For the final part of the 'linedef' tagging tutorials, we're going to
      create one more feature, falling floors - from this, you should have
      learnt enough to work out how any of the other features - except for
      doors, which are easily replaced by moving floors, etc. for a game like
      SRB2. If you want to add them, mail me and I'll think about putting an
      extra bit onto the tutorial.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Let's create a slight extension to our level, and
      make a diagonal corner, going into a larger room - for more variation.
      This time create two middle sectors, and an 'end' sector - this is roughly
      what it should look like -</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT><IMG SRC="tdiag06.gif" ALT="You can be more imaginative than this!" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480"></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The first middle sector (highlighted in the pic)
      should be a platform, (so higher than the previous sector, maybe just a
      step or a jump, it's up to you!) and the second one will be the falling
      floor. Make the ceiling for this sector taller than the previous sectors,
      but make sure Sonic won't hit his head on the ceiling! ;-D (you'll notice
      I'm giving you more freedom here, as the next step after this tutorial is
      to make your own levels!) - Finally, for the falling platform, make sure
      it's floor height is one fracunit away from the ceiling (e.g, Ceiling -
      480, Floor 479. Ceiling - 350, Floor 349.) and that the sector beyond that
      is EQUAL or HIGHER than the floor height of the platform.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now,the
      tricky-to-understand-what-I'm-talking-about part. Create a linedef that
      the player MUST walk across (no possible walkarounds) - for this example,
      I'd use the one linedef that the player has to jump on to continue...
      still don't get what I mean?</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If I put a box in the room, with all four linedefs
      triggering the floor to fall, it might work, but the player could still
      walk around the box, and jump up your platform...</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">...to hit a wall. Oh. Whoops. Wrong turn, better
      go back and so where I went wrong - in fact, they haven't made a wrong
      turn - they just missed the linedef. Remember, while you know where the
      trigger is, people playing your levels won't (initially). If the player
      starts in a said box, and has to walk out to start the level or something
      (see SRB2:HT Ring-platform trigger) then this is OK... but even then, it
      has it's flaws. Occasionally, if you jump diagonally, and very quickly,
      you can bypass the trigger entirely. No remedy has been found to sort this
      - though it might be finished by the final version.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The next thing to check with triggers is that the
      linedef is facing the direction the player will hit it. OK, now I'm just
      confusing you all, so I'd better use a quick diagram to explain what the
      hell I'm talking about!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">- is the direction a sidedef is pointing (inwards,
      outwards)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">| is a straight-forward, bog-standard linedef.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">-|</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Assuming Sonic goes from the left of the screen to
      the right, because Sonic is passing with the linedef pointing at him ( -|
      ), then the trigger should activate (unless the engine plays up - see
      above.). HOWEVER, if we get the opposite scenario...</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |-</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"> |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now, if Sonic crosses over the trigger line from
      left to right, nothing will happen, unless he turns around and walks back
      over the line, facing him ( |- )... do you get it now? If not... well...
      you'll see soon enough!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Anyway, after you've a
      'Must-cross-over-linedef-which-has-a-sidedef-pointing-to-Sonic' then you
      create the falling floor. Bring up the trigger linedef's properties and in
      'Class' go down to 'Floor' then goto to one of the following:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'W1 - Down to lowest floor' - Will bring the floor
      all the way down to the lowest floor it can go to - it will bypass your
      platforms... if you use this, make sure you set the appropriate textures,
      or you'll have some more screwy LSD results!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'W1 - Down to highest floor' - Will bring the
      floor down to the next highest floor it comes to - probably your platform
      or the bit after the falling floor. It's advised to go for this one!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">... and give the line a sector tag of 3. I guess
      you're wondering what the 'W1' bit means - time to explain that too!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">In the .wcf file, we have to set a number of flags
      to linedef... is it a switch (DooM only)? Do you have to walk over it?
      Does it work once or continously...? Therefore, here's Johnny Wallbank's
      Poorly Done Flag Definition Sheet, v 0.042b... and such.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">W - Must walk over linedef to trigger event. (What
      we've been using so far.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">S - Turns linedef into a switch / Must pull switch
      to trigger event. (DooM only. You can still theoretically use this for
      SRB2, but as we don't really have a 'Use' button anymore, it doesn't
      really work.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">X1 - Where X is one of the above, the '1' means
      that you can only activate this event once. This is the one that's most
      used in SRB2, though we rarely use Xr... explained below.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Xr - Where X is one of the above, the 'r' means
      you can continually activate this event if you walk over the line or hit
      the switch. Occasionally used in some levels.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Those are the one's you'll see most often. Give
      your falling floor sector a tag of 3 and run the level! Easy!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Hopefully, you should now understand how linedefs
      and triggers work... that was a bit disjointed, but it was late when I
      wrote this, and it's not the easiest thing to cover, that's about the
      hardest you'll do for a while, and once you master how it works, you'll be
      creating special features in your levels in seconds!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr8_01.wad" TARGET="">STEP 8:</A>
      </B>The level right now is a bit empty without enemies or rings! Time to
      create some... this will be a nice easy break from creating those
      specials!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Press 't' to go into 'Things' mode. Right click
      anywhere inside the level to start creating things. Firstly, we'll start
      with some Rings. Go down to 'Create new Thing'. You'll be presented with a
      list of items to choose from. You had a quick look at this when you
      created your Start positions, so now it's time to go in a bit deeper. In
      the 'Class' go down to 'Healing' - then select 'Ring (1)'. To save
      yourself doing this everytime to create a ring, just select the thing and
      press Ctrl + C to copy it, and Ctrl + V to paste it - it's also best to
      use 'Snap to Grid' to manipulate the rings easily.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">For starters, let's place two rings - one on each
      of the platforms we made at the very start of the level. Try and put them
      in the center to make them look nice. Though it doesn't really matter, for
      a simple tutorial. For the next challenge, form a ring formation at the
      bottom - I made a simple 5-ring formation... experiment for yourself! Make
      a diamond or a square of rings! In the end, you should have some that
      looks like this:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><IMG SRC="tdiag07.gif" ALT="Look at the pretty rings!" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Nice, huh? Now it's time to make an enemy. This is
      a bit trickier. Create a new thing as you did before, and goto the 'Enemy'
      Class... now, the enemy hasn't been named 'Ghost'... sorry! It's under
      'Cacodemon' (you'll see when you get a sprite of the classic DooM 2
      monster popping up in the white box... also use this to get a sneak peak
      at the enemies you can see in the final game (don't you feel so priviliged
      to have that honour? ;-D)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">One last thing to check - make sure the 'Level'
      boxes are all ticked, for now. This is the difficulty setting box, showing
      which levels to add / exclude. For later reference, here's how the Skill
      Level system works:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">1 - 'Sub Sonic.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">2 - 'Sonic.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">3 - 'Super Sonic.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">4 - 'Hyper Sonic!'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">5 - 'WARP SONIC!!'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Create this somewhere down the first tunnel you
      made, and prefferably, make it look southwards (at the player, when he
      jumps in). The rest is up to you... create more rings or enemies... when
      you're ready, we'll go into the final stage... using 'bar' textures.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr9_01.wad" TARGET="">STEP 9:</A>
      </B>Create a box sector after that, going off in a straight line (for now)
      Then add two futher box sectors on either side. Now - this is the tricky
      part. Set the main... yes the MAIN texture of the two lines running down
      the side (shown in the picture below) to GFZGRASS.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><IMG SRC="tdiag08.gif" ALT="The cyan and yellow lines..." WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Right! Ready for the complicated bit? Right click
      and goto the properties for these two linedefs. See that last bit of the
      linedefs box we've not touched yet? Time to fiddle with this! Set the
      Attributes to be ticked:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Impassible'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Two Sided' (on by default)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Lower Unpegged'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now run the level - it should work properly. If
      you get a garbled mess or if it's non-existant, check the attributes (and
      that you've given it a texture.) - while we're here, we might as well talk
      about the Attributes, and how you can use them:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Impassible' - No-one can walk through this,
      you'll just run against the wall. Useful for two-sided textures where you
      want to block someone off entirely (e.g, a falling pit trap, where they're
      meant to fall for the trap, etc.) or use a forcefield / bars, etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Block Enemies' - Same as above, but only applies
      to enemies.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Two-Sided' - Does what it says on the tin - don't
      try and set this on a solid wall, or you'll get some really freaky
      results... unless you want to create a phantom wall with a secret area
      behind it.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Upper/Lower Unpegged' - Used for doors / bars...
      no-one really understands these. They just... work! ^_^</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Secret' - Semi-hidden on the automap.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Block Sounds' - Not really needed for SRB2 - was
      used in DooM 2 to block off weapon noises.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Never Map' - Never appears on the automap. At
      all. Even if you jump up and down in front of it purple and naked. It'll
      still not appear on the automap.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Always Map' - The exact opposite - this
      linedef(s) will appear from the moment you start the level.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">After this... we'll go onto the last development
      step!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr10_1.wad" TARGET="">STEP 10:</A>
      </B>This is easy enough - a level exit! Make a small room after the 'bar'
      room. Create another thing... this time goto the 'Scenery' class and go
      down to 'End of Level Marker' - which is nicely labelled. ^_^</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Then you can either create a box around the level
      marker or a single linedef that you have to cross. Either way, assign this
      linedef to an 'Exit' in the class section and 'nW1: Exit level, go to
      next'. - test it in your level and walk over it... the end of the level!
      Congratulations! Now it's up to you to create your own, more imaginative
      levels!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>SUGGESTIONS AND TIPS FOR MAKING YOUR LEVELS:</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">1) It's very tempting to stick Sonic in a room
      with 900 ghosts in a single room to see if the player can survive, when
      you're a 'newbie' - but that's no fun. For one, the player will only last
      for a few seconds, get bored trying or just ignore the enemies and make a
      beeline for the exit, thus making it pointless.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">2) Try to give your level a theme - fair enough,
      this level didn't really have a theme, it was just a simple test. But when
      you make a proper level, you'll probably make a graveyard (a la SRB2:HT's
      level) - or maybe a more rocky / mountain based level. Think about the
      architecture for each. Rocky / Mountain will probably be more random,
      while graveyard will be more 'organized'.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">3) Fed up of those 'MAP 02 not found!' bugs at the
      end of SRB2:HT? Replace it with your own creation as an add-on! To do
      this, right click anywhere outside the level, then go down to 'Map Name'
      and set the Mission value to '2'. Save the changes and after the 'proper'
      level, you'll be finding yourself in your own creation!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">4) This tutorial only covered the basics - if
      there is enough demand, I shall add more tutorials on other things like
      teleporters, but first, ask yourself if you really need them!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">5) For the forthcoming SRB2:XMAS, there's a few
      new features and textures, so fiddle around with that!</FONT></P>
