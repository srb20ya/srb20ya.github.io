    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">That's it folks! The contest for SRB2:HT has
      ENDED. If you wanted to get your entry in, sorry, but Segasonic.net
      decided to choose a pretty bad time to crash - and a few later would have
      meant I'd have been on holiday, and the contest would have dragged on even
      longer, and I'd drown under all the mail. ;-D</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The winner? JoshKnux. How close was it?
      Incredible. If Josh hadn't found me online, he would have lost, and he
      only made the closing date by 3 hours. The chat I had with him was roughly
      as follows:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&lt;Me&gt; The SRB2:HT contest ends in 3 hours, so
      if you want to beat your 0:34 time, you'd better get a move on.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&lt;Josh&gt; Oh no! I'll never do it in time...</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&lt;Me&gt; Hard luck - you're in 4th place so
      you'll sti-</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&lt;Josh&gt; Good job I saved this .zip then!!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you were stockpiling your entry to something
      big, well... too late - although it's not entirely your fault, no-one was
      anticipating that Segasonic.net would pack up and walk out one day, huh?
      D'oh!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">But what does this mean for the rest of you? This
      seems to be leading more towards 'Let's congratulate JoshKnux!' than
      talking about the Time Attack - so I'll get to the main point after this:
      Thanks to everyone who entered, and bad luck to everyone who didn't quite
      get into the Top prizewinning 4 places... better luck next time!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now, although this isn't as big as the World
      Rankings, we're getting somewhere - the Time Attack option in SRB2 allows
      people to run demos of their level runs, and replay them afterwards to
      highlight mistakes and improve, from this, you can send us your times, and
      we'll be able to rank them for more prizes, SRB2 Soundtracks, and (plug)
      If you keep clicking on the eAds banner... cash! (/plug)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">We're even thinking about putting an option to
      Time Attack custom levels, so you can Time Attack your own creation,
      upload your level, and offer people to beat it! - The potential is
      enormous.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So, how do you get about making levels? Well, next
      diary will either kick-start our third section, the 'Development Diary',
      which is basically a weekly storyline of how SRB2 evolved, and other
      interesting aspects... or a tutorial on making levels (which will take a
      while to make, as I'll include sample levels to step you through the level
      making procedure) - there WILL be a tutorial, and there might even be a
      seperate section for this sort of thing.</FONT></P>
