      Part 1.</FONT></I></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>UPDATE 6/1/2000: </B>It appears that WADAuthor
      doesn't like the doom2.wad given in SRB2:HT, therefore, you will need to
      also download the real doom2.wad (from 'DooM II') to use the level editor.
      Get it <A HREF="http://stjr.segasonic.net/levels">here</A>... we now
      return you to normal White Glove Diarying (?!?)</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You've heard me blabble on for the past month or
      two now on making levels and add-ons. 'Yeah? Where's the proof?' You're
      thinking? Right here. This tutorial is pretty big, so I'll split it up
      into two parts - this part will cover the fundamentals and basics - if you
      want to go on further, you'll NEED to read this and understand it. Yes,
      it's boring reading the docs... no-one really likes it. But it's how me
      and AJ started level editing, and sadly - there isn't any other way.
      Sorry!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>STUFF YOU'LL NEED:</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Firstly - you'll need to download
      <A HREF="..\..\download\srb2\srb2ween.zip" TARGET="">SRB2:HT from here</A>,
      and <A HREF="..\..\download\misc\wauthor.zip" TARGET="">WADAuthor from
        here</A>. The last thing you'll need a special srb2.wcf file that's
      included in this .zip, if it didn't make it,
      <A HREF="..\..\download\misc\srb2.wcf" TARGET="">grab it here</A>.
      WADAuthor is the level editor I'll be using to cover this, but if you
      prefer DCK, we'll add a .zip of that in the near future - the techniques
      used are still similar in most cases.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">When the editor asks for your DooM2 set-up, just
      point it to your SRB2: Haloween Test folder and open doom2.wad when it
      asks where the main IWAD file is, and should be happy with that (the level
      editor was designed for DooM levels, but we adapted to using it for SRB2!)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To use this tutorial, you're going to need about
      half an hour of free time, and have saved this onto your hard disk drive
      for easy reference, so go ahead and save it now. For the various steps,
      we've produced special step-by-step .WAD files, which show you what the
      finished product should look like (obviously not counting increasing the
      room sizes - which won't make a difference, etc.).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr1_01.wad" TARGET="">STEP 1:</A>
      </B>After setting up the Level Editor, goto 'File_New' and get started!
      For the first step, we'll just make a simple box-room with somewhere for
      Sonic to start. Not exactly the most adrenaline rushing of levels, but
      it's where all the SRB2 levels we make start off as being.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">One last check until we get going. Right click
      anywhere on the empty grid and go to properties, and check that 'Include
      any files in external document' is set to 'doom2.wad' as seen in your SRB2
      folder.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Right-click anywhere in the on the grid, and
      you'll get a box, with the first three options being something like this:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'New Rectangular Sector'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'New Polygonal Sector'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'New Thing'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Goto the top option ('New Rectangular Sector') and
      select it. From here, you'll be asked to specify sizes, etc. Just ignore
      this - you're about to change this in a minute. You now have the birth of
      your level - a tiny box. Press 'L' to enter 'Linedef mode' (what those
      little white lines are around your box) and click and drag the lines out
      to make a simple box.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Next thing you'll need to do is set the textures -
      left-click on a linedef to select it, and right-click to bring up the menu
      again, goto 'Properties' and from here you'll be given a big selection of
      options. To the right, you'll see three panels in a 'Sidebox' window with:
      ABOVE, MAIN and BELOW and three empty boxes with a cross through them.
      Make sure the 'Front/Back' options are set to Front and then goto 'MAIN'
      and select the 'GFZROCK' texture (the one you see around the SRB2:HT
      level) and click 'OK'. Do this for the other three - or more simply, if
      you're confident with this, select them all, (drag n' drop or press Ctrl +
      Left Click to select the other three) and set the 'MAIN' texture to
      GFZROCK - don't worry about the other options, we'll get onto those as we
      go on.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Theoretically, you don't need to do this - you can
      actually run the level, but unless you want your levels to resemble a bad,
      wobbly, LSD trip, (think of the Hidden Palace Zone in Sonic 2 Final...
      only worse. =P) it's not recommended.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Next, we need to set the Floor / Ceiling heights
      for this box-sector. They should already be at Ceiling: 128 and Floor: 0,
      but we'd better just check. Go to the box, and press 'S' to enter 'Sector
      mode'. (The actual box) - Select it by left clicking, then right click to
      bring up the menu and goto 'Properties'. There we are - we can change the
      height if they're not the values I mentioned earlier. However, you will
      have to do some work here - You'll see 'CEILING' and 'FLOOR' in the Sector
      menu, and you'll have to get textures for these too. For the ceiling, go
      for 'F_SKY1' (the standard sky texture), and for the floor, pick FLOOR0_6
      (the grassy floor texture). Click 'OK'.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">We're almost ready to run the levels. One last
      thing to do is to add a Player Start. You WILL need this, otherwise - in
      most cases, the level will just crash. (or produce another 'Hidden Palace
      Zone' effect, with you starting slap-bang in the middle of a wall, several
      hundred miles away from where you intended the player to start.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To do this, right click outside the box and make
      sure no lines or sectors have been selected, right click and create a 'New
      Thing'. Goto the 'Player' option and then select the 'Player 1 Start'.
      Drag n' drop this INTO your box (if it's outside, you'll be trapped inside
      the walls and not be able to move).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Right! Now to run the level! Save this file as
      'mylevel.wad' or something more creative, but from now on, we'll refer to
      it as- 'mylevel.wad'... a word of warning - don't call it 'doom2.wad' or
      'doom3.wad' or you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY SRB2: HALOWEEN TEST. You will
      over-write the main data files and the game will probably crash or freeze
      if you load it. Then, after copying it, type this in the DOS prompt (or
      use 'Run' from the Start menu)!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><I>srb2ween -file mylevel.wad -warp 01</I></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">This will skip the intro screen and just get you
      started on your level! Congratulations! You've now made a level! Although
      it's not exactly very good, but it's a start!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr2_01.wad">STEP 2:</A> </B>Admittely,
      the level is very boring. You might get fun out of it for 5 seconds, while
      you look around and say &quot;Yay! I made my own SRB2 level!&quot; - but
      after that, the fun ends. Time to add a few features!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">For ease of making new sectors - it's best to add
      the these settings as a 'motif', which means every new sector you create
      for now on will have the same style as your first room - this also
      includes ceiling/floor height, so it doesn't do all the work for you! Goto
      Tools_Motif. When the Motif Menu comes up, set 'Above/Main/Below' textures
      to 'GFZROCK' - set the Ceiling to 'F_SKY', set the Floor to 'FLOOR0_6' and
      use '512' as your default ceiling height and '0' as your default floor
      height. Give your motif an original and easy-to-find name like 'Spooky
      SRB2HT sectors!' - if you plan to continue using WADAuthor and make more
      levels, and just keep calling them '(new motif name)' - then you're going
      to have a hell of a job finding which one is the DarkCity zone textures,
      and which one motif gave you a nice row of rocky walls, etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Things get a little more complicated as you begin
      editing the below textures. Right click INSIDE the box (you might have to
      make it a little bigger to accomodate the new platform and make it about
      128 units length and breadth. (Use 'Snap to Grid' if it helps - it's shown
      by a little icon in the top with a star next to the corner of a grid)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You're going to raise this block and make it a
      platform, so make sure you're in sector mode ('S' key, if you forgot!)
      then right click on the box and go to 'Properties' (or just double click
      on the box) and increase the floor height to 64 - in turn you'll have to
      increase the ceiling height for both of the sectors, try 256.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Right! All set? 'Wait! What about the MAIN
      texture?' you're thinking? Don't bother with that - however we'll need to
      add a texture (or face LSD-platforms)... let's have a quick look at how
      the texture system works. You have three texture faces to pick - 'ABOVE',
      'MAIN' and 'BELOW'. Here's a very quick diagram.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">N.B: You can use WadAuthor's special 'Bug Fix' to
      sort these out automatically - but it's far better to learn this in case
      something goes wrong!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">|</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">|</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">=</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">=</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">|</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">|= = = = =</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Presuming we go back to 2D-land here. The wall
      ABOVE the entrance to the hole is the 'ABOVE' texture. Even if it's only a
      single 'fracunit' away from the ceiling, it should be there (unless you're
      trying to make a fake 'invisible' ceiling or trying to do some other neat
      effect) - to be technical, everything ABOVE the linedef will need a
      texture, or in slightly less technical terms, everything from the ceiling
      needs a texture.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The wall BELOW the entrance to the hole is the
      'BELOW' texture. Even if the it's only a single 'fracunit' away from the
      floor, it should be there (unless you're trying to make a fake 'invisible'
      floor or some other neat effect) - to be technical, everything BELOW the
      linedef will need a texture, or in slightly less technical terms,
      everything from the floor needs a texture. (Bet you didn't see that
      coming! ;-D).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So, for this platform, 64 fracunits from the
      floor, it'll need a 'BELOW' texture. So far so good (probably not - it
      takes a while to get used to this!) - &quot;Wait! What about that '-' that
      sticking out of the middle of the line? Is that vitally important?&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes. If the previous paragraph didn't cause your
      brain to explode in a big, bloody heap - this definately will! (Therefore
      STJr cannot accept no liability if your brain explodes.) You'll have to
      now work out if you change the texture for the FRONT or BACK... the
      sidedefs. Ouch. You can work this out by looking at that little dash.
      It'll probably be pointing inwards to the platform. So what do you do?
      Here's where things get confusing! If it pointing INWARDS into the box,
      then you must set the BACK sidedef to a texture. If it is pointing
      OUTWARDS from the box (towards the bigger sector) then you must set the
      FRONT sidedef to a texture. Don't get it? Re-read it a few times and look
      at these pics! (Sorry about the godawful color scheme, but Paint was
      having a bad day... as usual. ;-D)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Done that? Don't worry - that's about the hardest
      aspect of the tutorial covered! If you get into real problems, just use
      Bug Fix. In fact, to save time, that's what we'll do for the next block.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><A HREF="tutr2_01.wad"><B>STEP 3:</B></A> Now,
      before you open fire on me with those gratitous weapons of mass
      destruction, lemme explain why I suggested you learn the above step
      instead of using 'Create New Block', 'Bug Fix', 'Fix All', 'Yay.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If all programs worked perfectly, we'd be in
      virtual heaven. We'd never need to worry about memory leaks (in fact, this
      has crashed on me at least once up to this point while I've been writing
      it.), that nasty General Protection guy who keeps giving us faults, and
      MKXM92_2.DLL which has caused an illegal operation and will be closed down
      regardless of how many hours work you've done. We'd not need to worry
      about re-installing Windows, and we'd all do the Sonic Adventure Time
      Trials a lot quicker.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Sadly, this isn't Dreamworld. Programs can and
      will crash / do screwy things / &quot;Whoops! That 'blow up half the
      level' option wasn't what 'New File' normally does!&quot;. Sometimes when
      you use Bug Fix, it can create some major bugs, not just the little 'No
      back texture found in Linedef 983' bugs, I mean bigger ones, which can
      cause quite a lot of headaches to track down - such as unclosed sectors.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Sector 134 is not closed, this sector will now
      look somewhat odd' will appear in the 'Bug Check' option if such a case
      happens, except perhaps the last bit about looking odd. This means you've
      got little 'bits' of sectors from one sector in another. If you go to
      'Sector mode' and highlight the offending sector, you'll usually see some
      linedefs which you didn't ask to have put in Sector 134, (i.e, from the
      other side of the level) - this causes WadAuthor to burst on the floor
      crying out loud, in turn, this causes the DooM engine / SRB2 to cry harder
      if you run the level, in turn, this causes you to throw something very big
      and heavy at your monitor.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">I've digressed a lot from the main point - we'll
      cover bugs later. DON'T be paranoid about using the 'Bug Fix'. 99.42% of
      the time I've used this, I've had no problems whatsoever, and it's very
      effective for quickly dealing with big platforms which have lots of back
      textures to set, and are tricky to select, because they're surrounded by
      other platforms, and so on - but it's warning of what could happen.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So let's create a new platform, in the same style
      as the old one, with a floor height of 128 - again, crank up the ceiling
      height to 512 so Sonic doesn't keep smacking his head on the ceiling when
      he jumps. Make SURE you do this for all the sectors, or you'll have some
      freaky looking sky and the Bug Fix will unnecasarily fix an 'Above'
      texture which it doesn't have to.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now, make sure you've got your Motif set,
      otherwise it'll assign the textures to be a load of rubbish, which will
      either cause 'LSD effects' or crash the level with a message of 'BLABLA_3
      texture does not exist in wadfile!' when you use Bug Fix. It takes the
      Above/Below texture data you put into the motif earlier and uses it for
      that. The Bug Fix icon, if you haven't already been hunting around for it,
      and sticking to the tutorial like a good little boy/girl. It's the little
      'Tick' icon at the top toolbar, or goto Tools_Check Map. You'll probably
      have this set of bugs:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Linedef a needs a lower back texture.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Linedef b needs a lower back texture.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Linedef c needs a lower back texture.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Linedef d needs a lower back texture.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'Map has no exit.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">'No Deathmatch starts.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">For now, we'll ignore the bottom two messages
      (although you can stick a Deathmatch start in, to get rid of the annoying
      message, if you want). You can either choose to fix the bugs manually, or
      just click on 'Fix All', which will fix all of the texture bugs in the
      blink of an eye! (It can't fix the bottom two - WadAuthor does not know
      where you want your start and finish to be!) WadAuthor can fix a lot of
      bugs using this - however, for some of the more major bugs ('No player
      starts', 'Sector is closed', 'Sidedef is non-existant' and so on), you'll
      have to sort them yourself.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Voila! The quick n' easy way to get it work! Not
      bad, huh?</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So we've covered the two basics features -
      Building sectors and platforms. If however you just had a level where
      Sonic jumped from one platform to the other in a straight line, it would
      be pretty dull. It's time to create a new sector and link it to the other
      to create a corridor.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Create a new sector anywhere you like, so long as
      it's not inside any of the three sectors we've made so far, prefferably
      above the three sectors so it's easier to manipulate. Drag it out to be a
      vertical corridor, just make sure it's 128 units wide .Use snap-to-grid at
      the top toolbar if you're having trouble - to find out how many units wide
      something is, look at the bottom when you select a linedef, it should say
      something like:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Linedef: (normal), v(x) to v(y), xyz units long,
      (number 0).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Ignore all of that, except for the 'xyz units
      long' bit, which'll be replaced by a number - how tall/wide the line is.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now, double click on the sector and change the
      floor/ceiling heights. Make the floor something like 192 - 64 fracunits
      above the second platform, so Sonic'll have to jump into the corridor.
      Make the ceiling height 292 - that gives Sonic quite a bit of head-room to
      make the jump... the bare minimum you can set this to is 64 fracunits
      above the floor. If you make this any lower, Sonic can't fit into the gap,
      and won't jump in - but the extra 34 units or so makes it easier for
      players to jump in / out of the room.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Also, make sure you change the ceiling texture -
      if it's F_SKY, your corridor will look a bit stupid - so change this to
      something 'more sensible', like FLOOR0_3, bear in mind - even though it
      says 'FLOOR' at the beginning does NOT mean it is merely restricted to
      floors. It's just a texture name.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">After setting the ceiling/floor heights, go back
      to the very first sector you made. We'll have to split the line up to give
      the corridor somewhere to snap on to. Go to the top wall, marked in the
      pic below... again, Paint isn't in the best of moods. *sob*</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT><IMG SRC="tdiag03.gif" ALT="Select the top wall." WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480"></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now you must split
      the linedef into three parts, to do this, right click on the linedef and
      select 'Split linedef' - Repeat this again to split the line again - don't
      worry about the texture data - it's been untouched, so you won't have to
      edit it again. Now, you'll have to enter 'Vertex Mode' to drag out the
      vertexes to allow the corridor to snap on. This is roughly what the final
      version will look like:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">(Assume each '-' to be 64 units long, and each '|'
      to be a vertex. Ignore the '(*)' for now.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">| - - | - (*) - | - - - - - - - - |</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Easy! Now, to connect the two corridors, you'll
      have to select the line from the corridor you just created earlier, and
      drag and drop it ON TOP OF the (*) line. WADAuthor should ask a question
      like &quot;Do you want to connect this linedefs?&quot; - Answer yes,
      and... voila! You've created a new corridor! The last thing you'll have to
      do is to fix the above/below textures for the newly-connected linedef...
      either get some practice in sorting them out for yourself or use 'Bug
      Fix'.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B><A HREF="tutr4_01.wad" TARGET="">STEP 4:</A>
      </B>So, we're starting to get somewhere! This step is more of a
      'challenge' step. Firstly, create a new motif - for the next bit of the
      level, we'll be 'inside' this tunnel for a while. The easiest way to do
      this is to go to your new inside-corridor and right click on the sector,
      and goto 'Create Motif from Sector', call it whatever you like ('Tunnels'
      or something...) and, using the same principle as above, 'lock on' the
      sectors - you won't have to split the linedefs this time - to try and make
      your finished product look like the wad in the 'STEP 4' link, or if it's
      broken or something, here's a picture (screwed up colours, courtesy of MS
      Paint!)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">This time you won't have to split the linedefs...
      you should be beginning to get an idea of how this works - make sure the
      ceiling / floor heights are all the same, or you'll have some strange
      results! Managed to get the finished result OK? This Step was
      comparitively short! Onto Step 5!</FONT> </P>
