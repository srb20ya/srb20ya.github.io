    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">After months of work on the TGF version of SRB2,
      I'd run into a fairly major problem - TGF didn't like big levels (around
      15000x2000 size) and ran at about the same pace as a hedgehog that been
      hit by a sizable limo would do... another problem arose - I had too many
      sprites, after a certain limit, they just refused to 'exist' entirely.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Combined, these problems meant either that I
      couldn't use 100 rings per level, have five scrolling screens or so per
      level and redoing the game using the same old TGF, which had a habit of
      crashing after you'd done lots of work... without saving.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So therefore, SRB2 shouldn't have existed, right?
      Wrong.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Luckily, Stealth had approached me with some ideas
      he'd had, and after seeing the god-awful 2D version, he quickly suggested
      a plan to do the game in C - after TGF crashed another two or three times,
      and my hair was rapidly vanishing by the second - I willingly accepted,
      and the TGF version became SRB:Xmas, without the bad bits. ;-)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">There was probably only one drawback - the music
      had to be in .wav form, other than that, I was very impressed by the demos
      Stealth was sending me.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So... what happened to get us to the 3D stage?</FONT></P>
