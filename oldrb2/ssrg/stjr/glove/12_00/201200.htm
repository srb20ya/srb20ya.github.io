<p><font FACE="Verdana">I bet that got your attention, didn't it!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Well, this isn't strictly the absoloute final White Glove Diary. Certaintely - the Off-Topic ones will continue until the day that one guy enter STJr's Top Secret Headquarters and blows up our office block. Which isn't going to happen anytime in the forseeable future, basically.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">And no, this isn't some dramatic announcement that I'm quitting the team or that AJ wants to have a drastic change in his lifestyle and become a monk. I promised myself that I would see SRB2 through to the absoloute end, no matter what happens. The only thing that will stop me working on this project would be my death. I hope that too, doesn't happen anytime in the forseeable future.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Funny that while I'm writing this, I've got the 'Theme of Grandia' playing, and it's just reached the 'sad' part of the tune. Well, as far as SRB2 is concerned, this will be among the last of the White Glove Diaries covering it. We've covered just about every aspect of the game, and then some. We're pretty much fresh out of things to write and I think everyone's fed up of me babbling on about how I think a game should be made, yada yada yada.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">But, this won't be the absoloute end. I'll probably write the odd SRB2 WGD when we release new demos, and so forth. Looking back on these WGDs, they certaintely have been a good move for the project, in my opinion. I'm still going to kick myself over the few stupid WGDs I wrote when I appeared to be drunk. The whole XMAS / AJ saga springs to mind.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Goodbye, but not farewell.</font></p>
