<p><font FACE="Verdana">After around 2¾ years of production, we've released several 'holiday' test versions and now we're officially entering 'alpha' stage (basically meaning we're getting pretty close to completion). There is another demo due, and most of you should have a pretty good idea of when to expect it.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">The big thing is however - did you like it? Going by the poll at the current stage, the result is clear - a whopping 80-odd% of you enjoyed the demo, and we hope to get that figure even higher for the second demo.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Most of the bug reports / gameplay issues can easily be resolved (such as 'I want more, bigger levels' - you can expect two more levels in Demo 2 and I'd say that Greenflower Zone 2 is at least x3-4 times the size of GFZ1) </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I personally thought that the demo we've done up to this point is fantastic. Some of you are probably saying 'Well, you WOULD say that, huh?', but I'm not just 'saying' that. If you remember, I wasn't too happy with the XMAS demo due to the serious SIGSEGV bug. Now that we've cracked it, and made the game a lot more stable and fun, I'm very happy with the progress. It's great to see all our hard work and effort pay off like this.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Better still - more people are taking interest in making levels. When the final game is out, and we release tutorials for making levels, I can relaunch the SRB2 Mod Archives.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Maybe there's a good chance for a more updated XMAS demo...!</font></p>
