<p><font FACE="Verdana">That's one heck of a title.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I've seen several American websites claim how lucky the Japanese are to get certain titles early or how unlucky they are that some titles don't get released in America. Believe me, this isn't half as bad as the situation in Europe and Australia.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I don't want to send anyone on a guilt trip, I'd prefer this to be some form of rant against game companies that refuse to release certain titles over here. Let's start with a little history. Nintendo somehow got this idea that Europe hated Nintendo stuff and they shut down their European office. Oh. This meant several great SNES games weren't released over here. I'll give you some examples later.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Why don't videogames companies advertise more? Sega's biggest downfall in Europe is the fact that Europe must have had a $100 advertising campaign, because I sure as heck haven't seen any television adverts for the Dreamcast since LAST Christmas when they were sensibly showing off Soul Calibur. Except they weren't. They were instead showing off the Internet capabilities which featured 'Joel' being beaten in Soul Calibur, in the form of an e-mail. No game footage whatsoever. In fact, I don't believe I've seen ANY game footage for ANY Sega game since a NiGHTS Advert back on the Saturn back in around 1995/1996. Sega of Europe, you fools. Don't complain that you have a serious lack of advertising budget, because the 'feeble' N64, which is not selling quite as well as the Dreamcast, are still advertising their games. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Nintendo thought we hated them so much that they didn't bring any Final Fantasy out here at all. It was up to Sony and the Playstation to release FF7 and FF8. OK, fair enough - they have more of a reason here, it does cost a fair bit for RPGs to be translated in other European langauges. But they didn't even release one game to see how the public would react before coming to this desicion. However, what's even sillier is the fact that NONE of the Megaman X games were released here. When I mention this to my online friends in America, they mostly refuse to believe me. Believe it. There is NO excuse for not releasing Megaman X 1, 2 or 3 over here. The dumb 'We have to translate into Spanish, German, French and Italian!' excuse does not work here. If you wrote out the entire scripts for all three of the games mentioned above, it might fill up about 30 pages of single-sided A4 paper.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">A reasonably good high-school student could translate MMX1-3. It doesn't require a multi-million dollar budget to translate the following:
<BR>
<B> MEGA MAN X: </B> I guess he's too powerful for me...<BR>
<B> ZERO: </B> Don't be so hard on yourself X! He was designed as a war machine. Remember that you have not reached full potential yet. When you have, you may even become as strong as I am.<BR>
<B> ZERO: </B> I'll go and look out for Sigma. You try and hold up the mavericks!<BR>
<BR>
That's, more or less, one of the more intensive conversation sequences from Mega Man X1. Just repeat this 30/40 times in length and we'll end we've the total amount of dialogue for the MMX games. Thank God for emulators, or I'd never of had a chance to play such great games.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">When Sony and the Playstation came into the scene, they could have release Mega Man X4 over here. Surprise, surprise, we never got it. Although the Final Fantasy games don't follow on from the previous ones, whereas MMX does, this doesn't stop new players from instantly taking the game back to the shop. I bet you an awful lot of money that we aren't going to get Megaman X5 either.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">We also end up with pretty enormous delays for games. Chu Chu Rocket was release in Japan in late 1999, I believe. America got it around March 2000, I think and we got it in June 2000. SoE was debating whether to release it, and in a startling new twist, gave the game away for FREE to all registered Dreamcast users! While this was a pleasant twist from the stingy SoE, this was a pleasant change, but why the delay at all?</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Final Fantasy IX. Released in Japan around June 2000, released only days ago in America and due to arrive here in 'The first quarter of 2001'. My friend got so fed up of this he went and got an import copy. Also, with the fact that Sega of Europe looks set to 'Pull a Saturn' and stop releasing great games over here (like Grandia, Radiant Silvergun and many, MANY more) in it's 'death days' (AKA: Lack of advertising). We're seeing this already. Sonic Shuffle has, to my knowledge no release date. Sonic Adventure 2 is due out Summer 2001 in Europe (the rest of the world recieves it on Q1 2001, although there are so many rumours going around, it's hard to tell fact from fiction) and SA3 may never be released here.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Unfortunately, Europe's not the only place which is suffering from things like this... Australia suffered with a HEAVILY delayed DC launch, few games at launch and no memory cards available for at least a week or so after launch which makes Europe's delayed DC launch last year look like a minor slip-up by comparison.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I'm not sure if Australia suffers from companies refusing to release games for strange and obscure reasons, but I'd imagine there must be some titles in America that don't end up in Australia.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Still, support has increased for Europe and Australia's video game industry a little since the days of the Saturn. It'll be nice when games that are released 'worldwide' include us too.</font></p>
