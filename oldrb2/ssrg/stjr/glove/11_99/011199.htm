<p ALIGN="left"><b>&nbsp;First, I'd like to clear something up - I (Sonikku) am not
dead. AJ Freda<br>
made it sound like that on the main page a few days ago, nor is he in charge<br>
of STJr now, however, he is tending to the page while I'm moving house.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Meanwhile, here's how we made the SRB2 levels!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;First, pick an editor! I use WADAuthor, but AJ prefers DCK. Either way, it<br>
doesn't make much difference - DCK has a bit more support for add-ons, but<br>
WADAuthor allows you to quickly make various features.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Levels are made up of sectors, which form your rooms, platforms, laser<br>
floor, Crusher o' Doom 2000, etc. , using the level editors you can add<br>
water, change floor / ceiling height, change textures (if it'll look like a<br>
rock, metal, grass...) and so on.</b>
</p>

<p ALIGN="left"><b><br>
&nbsp;But there's no point in having a nicely done level without any objects!<br>
You do need at least one object - a single player start - Without this you<br>
CANNOT run the level.<br>
&nbsp;Of course, this would lead to a very boring level, so add some badniks,<br>
rings and whatever else you like and place them where you like. Aerial<br>
badniks should be placed on higher ground, where they can ambush Sonic, for<br>
example.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;At this stage you can finish off and end it at the at, or - better still,<br>
go back and add decorations and fine-tune your levels! Did you have any bugs<br>
in the levels? What about multi-player mode... after you set off that trap,<br>
will everyone be able to make it through?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;There are, inevitably errors to sort out. If you forget to add a texture<br>
to a wall, it can give you a 'Hall of mirrors' effect, while this is good<br>
for comical effect, it looks a bit ugly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Other errors include objects inside objects, where enemies can get trapped<br>
inside other enemies and be stuck (again, good for comic effect), crushers<br>
can be set off in different sectors, and a whole bunch of other bugs that<br>
are guaranteed to annoy!<br>
<br>
