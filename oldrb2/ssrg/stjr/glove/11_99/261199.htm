<p><font FACE="Verdana">I think some apologies are in order.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Though it was about 11am and I'd just finished some fairly tedious
homework, there was little excuse for 24th November's tremendously awful WGD entry which
sent 90% of you to sleep. I hope that, someday, you'll forgive me for this. ;-)</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">The mod you've made is all well and good! You've made a few
levels, changed the Crawla to be green, instead of blue and given Sonic a pointy hat, as
well as fiddled with some other features. You can stop there, or you can go a little
deeper into the pool and create your play features etc. by programming.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">This is, obviously, only for those who have very little to do or
really want to make their mod different from the game. We should be releasing a copy of
the SRB2 source-code so people can to work and fiddle and tweak the engine - but again, we
don't want 'SRB2 which makes Sonic do the Conga dance half-way through the level!' mods or
'SRB2 with 0.05% jump increase' - while the first option would lead to some... interesting
results (that gives me an idea for a hidden secret anim! ;-D) it's not really worth
downloading 1.5Mb or so for.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I'm not going to post code examples in here - most of you probably
won't care about the programming and leave that to other people, so if you're not a
programmer, I'll end here: For those of you who keep bugging me and saying 'How do you
make videogames?' - you get C and sit down at a chair for a long time reading a book about
C until you learn how to code, then you code a game and lose your sanity.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">For C programmers though, the game opens a _MASSIVE_ amount of
possibilities up - for more long term projects, you could add Multiplayer 'bots', add some
Sonic Emblems into the level, turn the game engine into an RPG (think how we turned a 3D
shoot-em-up into a platformer!) - the list goes on and on for several miles.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">It's worth thinking about.</font></p>

<p><strong><em><font FACE="Verdana">Tails(A.J.):</font></em></strong></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">But wait, there's more!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">If you don't know programming, you can use DEHacked patch files!
It doesn't allow as much flexibility, but you can do several things, such as:</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">change cheat codes</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">change information about an object/how it behaves</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">change item pickup info</font></p>
