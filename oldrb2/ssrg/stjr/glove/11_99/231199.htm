    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Well, almost. =)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">It's been quite a while since we last updated the
      WGD, so here's a quick article until tommorow's articles on the WAD
      system.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">A 60% complete alpha of SRB2 has been released to
      the public - Sonic Robo Blast II: Halloween Test, and to add to the
      now-long-gone Halloween, we made it a special halloween version. Boo! Of
      course, it's by no means complete - There's still a lot of work to be
      done, especially in regard to the camera, collision detection and other
      bugs... but it's a lot better than it was this time last year, when we
      just had Sonic (then known as the 'Doomguy') walking through an empty
      level, armed with a pistol to shoot any non-exsistant foes standing in his
      mighty quest for the equally non-exsistant End-o'-level marker! My, my,
      how we've moved on. We hope you enjoy SRB2:HT (until we release
      SRB2:XMAST)!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">But as you'll know, it won't take long for you to
      beat up a couple of ghosts and run through a maze, will it? After about 20
      minutes, you'll realize that you've pretty much found everything now.
      What's left to do?</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Noticed that little <I>recween.bat</I> file in
      your SRB2:HT folder? Well - time to put it to use! On the 21st November,
      we decided to launch a competition, whoever beats the SRB2:HT level the
      fastest gets a rather special prize - the last of the intial five SRB2
      Soundtrack CDs!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Not to say it'll be easy by any means - if you
      enter, you've got to beat some good times! So - I'm going to offer a few
      tips, it's best to save these or remember them - a lot of them will apply
      to the final version, when... well, keep reading after these tips!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">i) Turn off the chasecam! Until we can make it
      'smarter', it's best to turn it off. To do this, goto the console by
      pressing '`' under the escape key and enter 'CHASECAM OFF'.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">ii) For those of you having problems with the
      water at the end, if you go to the right-most end of the pond, you'll find
      you can jump over the whole lake without using the platforms - until you
      build up enough confidence to do the jumps at the end at speed, it's best
      to take the latter option.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">iii) You can't go far without learning the maze
      route - after you've learnt how to get through it, try getting through
      quicker and quicker!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">iv) Hug the walls! If you run alongside a wall
      (particually if you strafe), you can get a huge boost of speed - you'll
      have to get used to doing this if you want to get into the top areas of
      the times!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">v) Turning quickly with the keybord is all very
      well, but the mouse is far better! Having problems with the controls? The
      mouse offers a lot more presicion for those quick turns and wall hugs
      you'll need to do - here's the control system I use:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">W - Forward, S- Backward, A- Strafe Left, D -
      Strafe Right, Mouse on freelook and high sensitivity for quick turns.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">vi) Listen to the 'Run through the Speed Highway'
      tune off Sonic Adventure - that shaved two seconds off my time. ;-D</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Good luck! But don't go away yet...</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">That's not all I've got lined up! With SRB2's Time
      Attack option, we'll be able to host the equivilant of SA's World Rankings
      on the STJr page! Sound good? How about cash prizes? I'm stocking up all
      the money eAds is sending me (and, shortly, AllAdvantage) to use as prize
      money, so I could offer monthly $20 prizes or something equally cool!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So even if you don't want to get involved in the
      Internet gaming option and race SRB2 players all over the world using the
      Multiplayer mode, you can still enter the Time Attack competitions and win
      there!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">But... we'll have to see! =) And now... back onto
      the main topic... Add-on developing...!</FONT></P>
