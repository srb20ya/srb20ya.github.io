    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">A few months ago, I posted an article on how SRB2
      will support multiplayer. Today, we're one step closer to getting there,
      right now, you can have co-operative gaming in SRB2, with up to four
      players, via LAN, Serial, Modem or Internet play.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">I have dabbled a little with online gaming from
      the early alpha versions (where Sonic still had guns) and even made daily
      deathmatch levels for me and AJ to battle over, and it was a blast. In
      both the sense of being on the recieving end of hot shotgun shells and
      incredible fun (especially when I incorporated my own super-super secret
      areas in these new levels that I used when the lag got bad. ;-D)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">OK, so right now we don't have any competitive
      modes, but co-operative play exists. And you can play online. Goodie. I'm
      going to talk to A.J into setting up a server on SegaSonic.Net
      (certaintely, after he gets the T1, there should be one... (plug)

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">How about lag? It'll be there, sadly, it's
      unavoidable with any sort of online gaming, but when I was playing against
      AJ, head to head, the client end (usually me, because I am better than
      A.J! Muhahaha! ;-D) got a ping of 300/400, which is pretty respectable,
      but for some of the more akward presicion jumps, I had a few problems.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Modem play, however, is more lag-free... so if
      anyone has some form of cheap international calling system, or lives in
      England... fancy a game? ;-)</FONT></P>
