    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If that title didn't confuse you, then you're a
      very... unconfusable person. Yeah.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The reaction on SRB2:XMAS v0.92 is pretty good,
      no-one has slated the new release to be worse than the old v0.90, and
      rightfully so, as the annoying SIGSEGV is (mostly) gone! Woohoo!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">And, Tristan did manage to find the joke we left
      for him (if you didn't understand what the whole 'Useless Options' thing
      was about, you will now!) and judging from the comments, that'll give us
      an extra 2/3 points! Yay! ;-) (Even though I REALLY don't get why anyone
      wants to use those options as 7 out of 8 of them are entirely worthless,
      with the exception of 'Gravity' which is cheating. =P)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Chaos Emerald was pretty pleased, except for the
      fact that we still have DooM style controls, which will be fixed sooner or
      later, maybe in time for 0.93, but perhaps not. In the meantime, the big
      pet hate is the camera. Most people find this to be annoying (which is why
      we DID put an option to turn it off in the the options menu. ;-D), others
      live with it, other live BY it (A.J Freda) and others would want to use
      various torture methods on it and refuse to use it outright (me).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">No-one actually seemed to however pick up on the
      changing of screen resoloution (everyone can find the useless options but
      not the useful ones? =o), the two player mode (though, in this version it
      doesn't work) or the fact you can create add-ons (though now a few have
      been released, with more on the way, it looks like it will actually be
      fast approaching...)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Meanwhile, what do I think? It was a great
      improvement over 0.90 (which even refused to run unless I got my text .exe
      and ran it through that), and is very enjoyable, though I mainly play it
      now to Time Attack and create add-ons. Though, remember, this is still
      only a fraction of what's to come, we've not put in the Multiplayer modes
      yet, Grading or character selection, but it'll come, with patience. =)</FONT></P>
