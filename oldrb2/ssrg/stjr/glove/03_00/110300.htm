    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">There has been a lot of misunderstandings and
      misconceptions about this whole matter, and to be brief, both of us are a
      little at fault.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Basically, Stealth was pretty polite and left STJr
      without any grudges, but I then later found out that he'd apparentely been
      insulting one of our programmers while he left, something I didn't think
      was quite so polite and jolly.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Which led to this impression that Stealth was just
      after the money we gave him, while he thought we were trying to get
      ourselves 'infinite fame and glory' from this one technique the programmer
      he had apparentely slagged off (he didn't.) to make the engine run faster,
      but I was unaware of the consequences, and things got into a tumbled mess
      from there.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So a misunderstanding on both parts - things have
      been resolved now, thankfully without any major battles or flamewars,
      however, though we've lost a major programmer, things aren't all bad. A.J
      is getting even better at programming, and has managed to fix multiplayer
      mode, and is adding plenty of new features for SRB2:XMAS v0.93.</FONT></P>
