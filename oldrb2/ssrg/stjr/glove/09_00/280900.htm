    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Well, after months of nothing on the WGD front, we're back again!The reason for this delay is due to the new design. It'd be hard for Mike to update this section while I was constantly churning out WGDs, so I waited for him to get it done - more on the design in a future WGD!</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, I KNOW SAGE ended about 3 weeks ago, but I still wanted to post my thoughts on itr - on with the WGD...</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">When I first heard about SAGE on the <a href="http://ssrg.emulationzone.org/fanmade"> Sonic Fan Games HQ Message Board </a> I thought it was going to be another project that probably wouldn't go too far. Boy, don't I look silly? It just so happens that SAGE was the best thing to happen in the Sonic fan-game community (for about 85% of it anyway, if <a href="http://tssz.emulationzone.org"> TSSZ </a> is anything to go by.) </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">I think Blaze managed to accumulate around 1500 hits or so in the three days of the expo. That's pretty darn impressive. Though there was the dissapointment of people not showing up and last minute entrants, that didn't stop people having fun. The fan-game developers got the chance to show off their latest projects, while fan-gamers got the chance to see it in action or play it. (The latter was best demonstrated by Rlan's enormous booth, full of playable mini-games and work he's been doing.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Everyone at the show managed to offer something good for all - project information, games, videos, dancing moogles... oh you missed them? They were at Kulock's booth for about 42 seconds.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Seriously though, despite Blaze's occasional woes because all the big websites seemed to consider SAGE a minor non-event (some websites even went as far as saying that 'we curently see no justification in linking to your site' and then spamming them. Gee, way to support your fans.) - it will be bigger and better. The no-shows from this year will be more likely to make sure they show up next time.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">As far as changes I'd like to see for the next year - I'd have to suggest that the show lasted a few days longer (maybe even a week); while three days works well for a 'real-life' expo, there aren't as many big things happening at SAGE (at least, this year's schedule seemed to be a tad sparse), and with time zones, it makes scheduling events even more difficult. A few more days might help people schedule these events.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">All in all, SAGE was a massive success. I hope that in six months time the (minor) problems will be sorted and SAGE will be even better. Thank you Blaze, for making it happen, and thanks to everyone that made it a success.</FONT></P>
