    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">A lot of people wonder what would happen to SRB2
      if I woke up the next morning and got crushed to death by a slightly
      gigantic piece of cheese, certaintely, while this hasn't happened yet (and
      hopefully won't, for a while) it's come pretty close. BT almost got me by
      kicking me off the Net, thanks to Freeserve for the backup. The house move
      left a lot of people thinking I had spontaneously combusted / died in some
      form, and what AJ originally posted as a joke (&quot;KU IS DEAD! HE'S NOT
      REPLIED TO MY E-MAIL FOR A DAY!&quot;) ended up as being serious news
      around various Sonic sites. I had to quickly hurry and clean up the mess.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">But even so, tragic (or not) as me dying or
      'net-dying' might be, it wouldn't have all that much effect on SRB2, as
      I've laid down the design rules, and I've completed practically all the
      level designing, and the site design is intact, then I guess it wouldn't
      really make all that much difference.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So folks, next time I'm in a so-called
      'near-death' crisis, don't worry, the rest of the team are perfectly
      capable and responsible...</FONT></P>
