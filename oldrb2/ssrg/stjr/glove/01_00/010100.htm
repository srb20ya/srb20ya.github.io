    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So things were going smoothly - SRB2 is having a
      great new engine, and we've got a zone done already. What went wrong?</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Firstly - Stealth was gone, moving house and
      needed to sort things out for a while - because of this SRB2 wasn't making
      much progress.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Then, A.J came in and gave me a revised plan of
      the engine, I'd seen what he's done with Sonic Doom II - granted, it was
      no-way near reaching a full platform game, but AJ showed me that it was
      possible, after some days of thinking about it, combined with what was
      happening in SRB2 right now, I made the desicion to move to 3D.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">And from there, things moved along at rocket pace
      - after a few days, we'd already got all three Greenflower levels up and
      running - granted, at this stage, Sonic still bounced around, waving a
      pistol, and the enemies consisted of Brak-Eggmen, which had to be shot
      down, but it was progress.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">From there, the game moved along quickly... the
      engine was, after six months, finally set in stone, with a plethora of
      planning ideas - SRB2:3D was beginning!</FONT></P>
