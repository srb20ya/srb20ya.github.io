    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">A problem we had to face at STJr was everyone's
      morale; including my own... SRB2 development hadn't always gone well - at
      times, things have gotten so bad, that we've actually considered canning
      the game entirely... as me and A.J were chatting, we eventually found that
      we had ended up with the programmer being... well... just A.J Freda. This
      is from a chat log I can remember having...</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;But I thought fAb and Boris (of 'DooM
      Legacy' fame) were offering to help us?&quot; I said.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;They just said post something on the DL
      forum.&quot; A.J said.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;What now then?&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;Why not can the game?&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;We've been working on it for over a year
      now, we can't can it NOW!&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;Why not? I canned Sonic Doom 2 for SRB2.&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">It continued from there... but we managed to keep
      things going, however, we did have some problems... people expected a lot
      from a 3D game, particually after the release of Sonic Adventure! Don't
      worry though! SRB2 <I>will</I> be out, and up to the high standards you
      expect us to give you!</FONT></P>
