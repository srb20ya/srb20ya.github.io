    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">I guess this is more of a general summary of
      STJr's career... but let's start with some humour!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">When I was about 2 or 3 years old, I had a
      monumentally stupid idea. I looked at this (then-heavy) milk carton and
      decided to see what effect it would have if I poured it on my head. I
      cracked it open, and began pouring the white,
      quick-to-smell-like-rancid-Cheeseburgers liquid all over my head. It was
      at this point I found out that milk was NOT intended to help wash hair...
      or at least, if it was, someone had made a fairly fundamental flaw
      somewhere along the line.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">And this has what to do with the highlights and
      not-so-great things in SRB2? Not much really, apart from the monumentally
      stupid ideas bit.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The idea of adding flickies in, a la Sonic 3D
      Blast... suffice to say, this lasted as far as the 'thinking up' bit, and
      was dismissed about 0.5 seconds later, some parts of the level design were
      just... odd, along several others things that I can't / don't want to
      remember</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">However, despite the occasional mistake, we mostly
      come up with good ideas - A.J thought up of the White Glove Diaries, which
      has remained pretty popular since, with mini-editorials and essays on
      SRB2's progress, sprinkled with humour and cheese. (Haha.) The message
      board has got well over 700 posts in a short 3 months. The site redesign
      has reduced the 'Let me redesign your site!' e-mails from one a month to
      none and STJr hasn't been down since the move to the SSRG.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">But there's still time for a few more major
      problems.. and even more good ideas! ^_^</FONT></P>
