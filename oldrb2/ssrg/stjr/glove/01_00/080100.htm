    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">After six months, and the engine set in stone, we
      were armed to the teeth with planning ideas from the 2D versions. There
      were some interesting varations that were in line...</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Firstly, was the mixture between first and third
      person views, with the new version of DooM Legacy coming up, SRB2 could
      have a neat auto-camera that would chase Sonic - how about controlling it
      to suit your tastes?</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Next - The multiplayer ideas. As DooM engine
      already had an on-board Multiplayer feature, we could easily drop in
      Multiplayer. Instead of guns, how about races, capture the flag and
      survival mode? And how about the split-screen option that the DooM Legacy
      team had in line?</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">After a while, we thought of including moves for
      the characters, while Sonic has his new 'Air Spin Attack' - to make
      maximum use of Sonic's incredible speed, Tails can fly, to take advantage
      of the shortcuts found, and to take new routes that Sonic normally
      couldn't. Knuckles meanwhile can glide effortlessly through the air, so
      while not as potent as Tails' flying skill, he could make up by climbing
      some walls, to also get to some areas Sonic couldn't reach.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">What about the replay value? The Grading option...
      Time Attack option... ability to add levels and mods? A lot had to be
      considered, and we're still fine-tuning some of those to suit all the
      gameplay options we had in line!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+2">Next time: 'Can it!'</FONT></P>
