    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">About a month and a half ago, SRB2:XMAS v 0.9 was
      unofficially released to SRB2:XMAS. I had woken up on the Saturday and
      found out that I was not allowed on by BT Weekend due to 'Unknown
      problems'... meaning that the phone bill was going to racked up this
      weekend. Great. I hopped on to the normal account and began my Sonic
      surfing. I began with Sonic HQ, The Super Sonic Zone, SSRG, STJr, Sonic
      Fan Games HQ, The Soni--- wait a sec! I looked at the Sonic Fan Games 
      HQ... 'SRB2XMAS IS OUT!' was plastered all over the top.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;Aw s**t!&quot; I thought, &quot;A.J released
      something without telling me AGAIN!&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Still, I didn't worry, so long as he'd made the
      game up to scratch... how disspointed I'd be. While downloading it, I
      checked the Sonic Fan Games HQ message board, only to find somehow who had
      problems getting it to run... hoping that it would just be me, I unzipped
      it, and ran SRB2:XMAS - I had not a good day so far... BT Weekend didn't
      want to let me (and a good 35% of their customers on), A.J had ignored me
      again, and I'd already found a complaint for SRB2:XMAS. I needed a good
      way to calm down.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">...Which I wasn't going to get. I doubled clicked
      on 'srb2xmas.exe' and waited for the DOS box to pop and load... I got the
      DOS box, and this message...</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;Oh no! Back to reality!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">SIGSEV ERROR IN 4322:3829 8329:9229...&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Cue lots of profanity... A.J had made a game that
      no-one could play! How the HELL could anyway miss that? It takes just two
      clicks to see if something boots up! I eventually found out, that
      (thankfully) this only affected Win '98 Release 1 users. A.J then told me
      that he'd released it quickly to 'punish' people for asking for it to be
      released.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So, by this theorum, whenever I ask for some fries
      and a Bacon Double Cheeseburger at Burger King, I should recieve a
      steaming pile of hot cow dung.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">I couldn't let this go on. A.J's power trip was
      over. It was time to get a proper programmer. Stealth said he'd played it,
      and offered to help us program. Without hesitation, he was in the team,
      and A.J was back to sprites...</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">&quot;But I thought he'd angrily left after SRB2
      turned 3D and hated the whole idea?&quot; - A good 10 months later,
      Stealth had played SRB2:Haloween Test, and realized that it was possible
      to re-create something from the DooM engine... before this, Stealth had
      found a 2% complete in-development alpha, which basically had Greenflower
      1 and half of Greenflower 2, no rings, no jumping, one badnik, Sonic had a
      pistol and the old DooM textures, which he was, quite understandably not
      impressed with.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Though he was very surprised at how far SRB2 had
      come from being a cheap clone of Sonic DooM 2, he and I both knew that it
      had a hell of a long way to go before it was anywhere near the top-notch
      standards all the Sonic fans were expecting.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">So here we are now... with a much stronger
      programming team and the Sonic sprites coming along a lot quicker!</FONT></P>
