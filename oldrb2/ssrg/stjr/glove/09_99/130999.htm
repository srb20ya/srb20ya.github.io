<p><font FACE="Verdana">Welcome, once again to the White Glove Diaries, Johnny 'Sonikku'
Wallbank here, this time we'll be going through add-ons and expansion packs for SRB2.
(Which may eventually lead to a whole web address called 'www.srb2files.com'!) ;-)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;Yeah, but who's gonna pay the $70
domain fee?&quot; -Tails</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;Just joking... ever heard of
www.halflifefiles.com?&quot; - Sonikku</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Firstly, let's start with levels, it'll be really easy to make
these. But as for whatever choice of level designer you use is up to you. Hopefully, the
DooM Legacy team will produce a level designer specially for the engine, which'll let you
create your own version of Greenflower Zone 1 or Deep Sea Zone 1 or another level
entirely! We might even hold competitions to see which level design is the best! My
personal favourite level designer is 'WadAuthor', though A.J. Freda much prefers 'DCK',
we'll offer a choice of these on the website and tutorials on how to use them both, from
creating a simple four wall room to adding neat effects like translucent water and glass,
secret areas, etc.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">I still have a sketch of the original GFZ1 level, take a look
below:</font></p>

<p><img src="../../z1m1.GIF" width="584" height="488" alt="z1m1.GIF (9001 bytes)"></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Now we've put this into the level editor... (Taken from WinTex) </font></p>

<p><img src="../../srb2l1.gif" width="440" height="254" alt="srb2l1.gif (4245 bytes)"></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">And here's how the final level looks, and how we compare it to the
finished thing! </font></p>

<p><img src="../../srb2l2.gif" width="460" height="300" alt="srb2l2.gif (2186 bytes)"><img
src="../../srb2sl1.gif" width="320" height="200" alt="srb2sl1.gif (20923 bytes)"></p>

<p><img src="../../srb2l3.gif" width="460" height="300" alt="srb2l3.gif (1565 bytes)"><img
src="../../srb2sl2.gif" width="320" height="200" alt="srb2sl2.gif (25508 bytes)"></p>

<p><img src="../../srb2l4.gif" width="460" height="300" alt="srb2l4.gif (3551 bytes)"><img
src="../../srb2sl3.gif" width="320" height="200" alt="srb2sl3.gif (24226 bytes)"></p>

<p><img src="../../srb2l5.gif" width="460" height="300" alt="srb2l5.gif (1814 bytes)"><img
src="../../srb2sl4.gif" width="320" height="200" alt="srb2sl4.gif (23921 bytes)"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Next, we've got texture editing - Don't like the textures? Change
them. Using more software, you can easily recreate the entire textures in the whole game,
make 'SRB2 Physcadelia' or 'SRB2 Graffiti', just make a backup of the original main .wad
file and get editing! </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Depending on how you want to edit the game, you'll probably just
want to do level designing so you can make your own multi-player levels. After this,
you'll probably be after sprite editing, before fiddling with the game physics, etc.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../srb2sl5.gif" width="569" height="452"
alt="srb2sl5.gif (15323 bytes)"></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Texture editing fun!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Meaning, doing this... you could create SRB2 expansion packs, or
just a few simple levels. Perhaps we might even make a section allowing you to give us
your levels so everyone else can try your creations, but that depends on the popularity of
this and if we'll just end up getting levels that are just a box with a badnik, a Ring TV
and a level exit sign. We'll probably get a new e-mail addy called
'srb2submit@segasonic.net' or something, whenever the mail server is up. And, BTW, if you
liked the 'ButtShot' movie, we might make more humorous deathmatch .rm's if you want. =) </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+2">Next time: SRB1 vs. SRB2! </font></p>
