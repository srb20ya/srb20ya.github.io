<p><font FACE="Verdana">Welcome to the opening of this section! Not much has been said
about SRB2 for a while, and a lot of people are probably wondering if it still exists.
Well, it does, and the progress keeps going! When the Sonic X-Treme sprites were released
over at Secrets of Sonic the Hedgehog, I made a Sonic Xtreme sprite for SRB2 to have fun
with. Even though it fits great into the game (the graphics converted to the proper
palette without almost any changes!), it will not be in the final version, because then
the handdrawn Tails and Knuckles would look strange. Since SRB2 is VERY easy to make
add-on packs for, I'm thinking of doing a Sonic X-treme add-on pack. On a lot of these
screenshots you'll see the Sonic X-treme sprite... that's because I like to use him for
testing.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">The OpenGL version is coming along VERY nicely..... a new feature
called Field Of View (FOV) increases the field of view. We're thinking of taking this and
having the FOV increase the faster the player moves.... see below. </font></p>
