<p><font FACE="Verdana">Huzzah, it's me, Sonikku updating this time, on Netplay!
Firstly... why did we call this 'Sonic's White Glove Diaries'? We thought of making it
similar to Sonic X-Treme's 'Red Shoe Diaries'... with one major difference, SRB2's going
to be completed!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">So, onto the main topic - Netplay. Firstly - How the heck can you
play a Sonic game over the Internet? Firstly, there's the co-op mode, which is the Single
Player mode, but fighting with up to four friends, or alternatively, you can play the
Survival mode with up to four players, where you have to try and out-survive wave after
wave of badnik attacks, OR you can play the Race mode with up to four players, which is
similar to Sonic R, where you have to run around a course to the finish... OR you can play
Capture the Flag mode for up to a massive thirty-two players! Here you have to try and
capture the other teams' flag and hurry back to your base! </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana"><font SIZE="-1">Bashing bots in the co-op mode!</font>
</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">Wait - Why only have 4 players in the other modes?
With co-op mode, it'd be just plain stupid having 32 players running around the level,
with one person hitting all the badniks, and the rest all crowded behind said person.
Repeat process until bored... it wouldn't work. The survival mode might be possible, but
right now, it's still at 4 players... Race mode? Imagine a 100 meter race with 32 racers
all crowding around the starting block... or Sonic R with 32 players crowded around the
start block... that wouldn't really work, although 8 players might be a possibility worth
considering.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">Next - how well does it run? Will Sonic be playing at
a fairly smooth speed without any lag, or will it be like playing in superglue? For anyone
who's not played a Net game, 'lag' is the time it takes for your player to move, for an
example, if you had a ping time of 120ms, it'd take 120 milliseconds for you to move (.12
seconds), on the other hand, if you have a ping of 870, it'd take 870 milliseconds to move
(.87 seconds). Considering that I live in England, (where the net services aren't exactly
great) and A.J. Freda lives on the other side of the world in America, the lag isn't too
bad. Certainly better than a game of Quake II in a UK server for about 6-8 players.
Although whoever's being the server (usually A.J.) almost always wins the game. A new
version of the engine we're using will be coming out soon that will fix a lot of the
delays and netplay problems by using a technique called &quot;Client Prediction&quot;.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">OpenGL users too, will have an unfair advantage,
being able to look straight up and down, instead just a little bit in the software mode...
the results can be quite comical, as seen in this demo of a Deathmatch between Tails (A.J.
Freda) and Sonikku (Me)... I don't know if A.J. makes a habit of this... ;-D</font> </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;I was NOT using OpenGL Sonikku! I
told you! I was just able to do...this.... hehehe&quot; - A.J. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Sonic had a good day today. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">&quot;Wait a minute! Did I hear you say Deathmatch
mode back then? So DooM is going to be in this then?!&quot; - If that's what you're
thinking then don't worry, in this version, we were still using the old DooM Legacy
engine, which meant that we could only Deathmatch or CoOp in Netplay. This won't be in the
final version! Unless you use a cheat code, you won't be blowing off the heads of any
robots with a sawed-off shotgun (or a chainsaw, if you're A.J...) - I can't stress this
enough! </font></p>
