Dreamcast!</i></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">That's right! Just when you thought things couldn't get any
crazier... how about SRB2 for the Dreamcast? That's right! Download SRB2 using your
Dreamcast and get playing or just ask us for a free GD-Rom! =)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;It would be on CD-ROM silly! What
do you think I have, a GD-ROM stamping plant?&quot; -Tails (A.J.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;Um, joke?&quot; - Sonikku</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Well, we'll have to see - The prospect of this ACTUALLY happening
isn't too clear... but we'll have to see how it goes... perhaps (with the DC Net option to
download new files) SRB2 could be the first upgradable console game ever, limited only by
the amount of blocks on your VMS memory card! ^_^ </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;Oh suuuuree... VMS..... all its
going to be is a WinCE 2.0 port....=P&quot; -Tails (A.J.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;Argh! I was J/King!&quot; - Sonikku</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">As well as getting new levels / skins / etc. You can also play
over the Net and beat those PC users into bloody pulps - That right! We're taking the
computer vs. console war to the next generation! Or something like that, anyway. Now for
the VMS memory card system - If we can get this work (as well as all the other options
about the net, etc.) then you could play mini-games on the run... depending on how well
you'd done in the actual game itself, you'd get more mini-games opened up and... MADNESS. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;Okay, but you pay the
programmer...&quot; -Tails (A.J.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">&quot;I'm sorry God... I will never joke
again in the next life. *Sobs*&quot; - Sonikku</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">It's still a fairly big 'if' about whether any of the above will
happen, but if it does, it'll certaintely be a big first for loads of Sonic fan-games! </font></p>
