<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="+2">Updated and maintained by Johnny
'Sonikku' Wallbank and A.J. Freda</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FF0000"><i><b>Wednesday 15th

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FF0000"><i>SRB1 --- vs ---
SRB2</i></font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">Sonikku here, I'm back, having pre-ordered a British
Dreamcast, which I'll now have to wait another month for... *sob* Anyway, I digress - I'm
back with a whole new article on how to change milk into cat hair! I mean, SRB1 vs. SRB2!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">Due to another change in PCs, until I get the old PC
back on the network, I can't update the page myself, but thanks to A.J., STJr is still
going!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">So... SRB1 vs. SRB2. A few people are still doubtful
of whether or not the many secrets of SRB1 will make a sequel in SRB2. Don't worry,
they'll be back (the Out-takes and a few secret levels you'll have to find), along with a
few others (Yorkshire mode, Druken-Football-Fan-From-Liverpool mode, hidden characters
including the 'Classic' mode and loads of hilarious cheat codes.)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">SRB2 should also last a lot longer! With a Time
Attack mode for all the levels (not just the Multiplayer ones this time. ;-D) , after
completing a level, try beating it against the clock, and upload your times to the STJr
page for more prizes! Yay! (Anyone who's got their hands on the internal alpha - My best
GFZ1 time is 8 seconds...)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">Also, the multiplayer (as stated in an earlier White
Glove Diary) isn't limited to just psuedo split-screen as SRB1 was, as you can now fight
worldwide for... um... a big ego! Yeah! That. *Ahem*</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">How about the bugs? Yes, SRB1 wasn't exactly
bug-free, with the occasional 'Hey! Why did I lose all my rings when I hit that badnik?!'
and 'That was meant to be a solid floor!' and even the odd 'Oh! So that burnt pizza was
what that smell was...', don't worry! SRB2 is considerably less-bugged. Right now though,
the auto-camera does get stuck behind a lot of things and is a bit... well... dumb<font
SIZE="-2">*</font>. =P</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">The music isn't all music from the other Sonic games
now, as we have our own soundtrack! We might give another copy of the soundtrack away
sometime if we feel like it, so look out for a future competition.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A picture of the Soundtrack label!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">And as for the graphics, well, they're not really
supposed to be as much as a big issue in games, but only a select few people liked the
graphics in SRB1 (i.e, no-one), but then again, I drew them using _ MS Paint_<font
SIZE="-2">**</font>. And I was 12 years old back then, so cut me some slack, =P. But I
digress, the graphics and the cut-scenes are far, far superior to the shoddy ones seen in
SRB1. So don't worry.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Verdana">Lastly - Download size... again, SRB1 wasn't exactly
small. The first, 'hi' version would set your HD space back around 28Mb. The zip was about
11Mb big and took forever to download. The 'lo' version was only about 14Mb and the zip
was only around 6Mb big and took about an hour to download on an average connection. We
estimate the final SRB2 copy to be 7Mb big unzipped. Blimey! ...Basically, let's cut a
long story short, when SRB2 comes, you'll wondered why you ever downloaded SRB1! </font></p>

liability for emotional damage done to any auto-cameras' reading this page and we
apologize in advance if we have. </font></p>

use of MS Paint and we apologize for even mentioning it. </font></p>
