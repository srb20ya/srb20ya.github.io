<p><font FACE="Verdana">Sonikku here again... Righto! For the past few days, if you've
been an avid fan of the White Glove Diaries, which you probably haven't, then you'll of
been looking at the 'Next time...' box, which said 'Sonic the director!'</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Right. That's good. What's not good is that you probably have no
idea what the heck I was talking about.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Anyway, what has being a director got to do with SRB2? Well, with
SRB2, you can make your own movies! Strictly, this should be in add-ons, but I thought it
deserved it's own special section. First and foremost - With SRB2 you can make demos of
your run-thru the game. Meaning now, instead of relying on screenshots whenever we ask you
to send in you SRB1 times, we can look at a demo and prove it - With your permission,
we'll upload to the site so other people can see how you managed to beat Mine Maze 4
seconds quicker than I did. =) </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">But - It doesn't stop there. You can take the camera and mess
around with it to produce a movie-like effect, for the promo demos, we'll be fiddling
around with our level runs to make it more of a movie.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fun using the chasecam to record movies!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">So, all you can do is just make flashy level runs. Whee! That'll
be fun. For about two hours. Nope, anyone remember the Quake Movies? (I should, I starred
in Dantooine Five-Oh! ;-D) Well, you could make your own SRB2 movies, that's right! Drop
that expensive $1,250 copy of Lightwave for making movies about Sonic using .avi's and
instead use the SRB2 engine!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Well, we're obviously going a bit over the top here... but it's
possible. All we need now, is a big star to voice as Sonic and enough in our budget to
hype it up to death! And then it flops. Oh well. =) </font></p>
