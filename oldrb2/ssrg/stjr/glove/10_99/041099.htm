<p><font FACE="Verdana">You know what? I'm bored of doing this, so let's cut to the
commercials.... just kidding! What's with the commercials then? We've got four commercials
lined up, and will be launched around various websites on the Sonic net community!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">What will the commercials be about? Well, we'd be spoiling it if
we gave it away - But they'll all have DIFFERENT video footage of SRB2, some multiplayer,
some single player. The animation is done by resident movie meister, A.J. Freda!</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">If you liked Pokemon Soccer and the forthcoming Pocket Lapse
(available from the main Segasonic page) and it's... rather strange sense of humour, then
you'll love this, with more insane voice acting done by Sonikku and A.J. Freda... guest
starring David Bulmer as himself. Will he die at the end of the commercial? Of course. Is
A.J. good as a psychologist? No. Can I hold a fixed cheesy grin? Probably not, but you'll
find out in the commercials! </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">More news on them as they come! </font></p>
