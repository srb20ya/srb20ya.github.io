difficult?</i></font> </p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Hey! Here's a party hat. Happy birthday to me! I am now 15 years
old and still um... doing stuff. Yeah. Sorry about that off-topic bit, but today I
_should_ have been upstairs spending all my time on the new Dreamcast, but alas, it's been
delayed until next week.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">Maybe I should stick this question in the FAQ, but I'll just do it
in here instead - </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Verdana">Q: Will SRB2 be hard? </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">A: Yes. And no. Depending on the skill level you select.
Certainly, you won't have to be fighting the evil 'Killing-dead' bug anymore. The only
thing you really need to worry about now is dodging that machine gun as well as stopping
yourself from falling down into that pit o' doom.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">You can also make it harder by trying to get the emeralds and get
a good grade at the end of the game, but as far as making it from one end of the level to
the other in one piece goes, see above paragraph.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">But again - I stress - It... won't... have... the... Killing...
Dead... Bug! You can safely bounce/punch/destroy most enemies with no problems at all
(except enemies that might have spikes guarding them, etc.)</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana">As far as finding secret levels will go - You've got a tough task,
but for a hint on how to find the Speed Highway level, go back from the exit in the Deep
Sea Zone... you'll find something eventually... </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="+2">Next time: Secret stuff!</font></p>
