'Sonikku' Wallbank and A.J Freda</font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font color="#FF0000" face="Book Antiqua"><big><em>Make your own
characters</em></big></font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><big>I know Ku said that this
was supposed to be about level designing, but I'd rather make it about how to make your
own players to use in SRB2! If you complete a &quot;skin&quot; using this tutorial, and we
like it, we'll include it in SRB2!</big></font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><big>Now, first, you need a
WAD editor, such as <a href="http://stjr.segasonic.net/wintex.zip">Wintex</a>. It might
require you to have Doom or Doom2, I'm not sure.</big></font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><big>Download this <a
href="http://stjr.segasonic.net/template.zip">template WAD</a> and open it up in wintex.</big></font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><big>You should see something
like this:</big></font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><img src="spr1.gif" width="605" height="422" alt="spr1.gif (12456 bytes)"></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>Ignore the SS_START and SS_END entries. It's the PLAYxxxx entries you
want.</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>Each of the xxxx after PLAY defines the character's state. If you
click on an entry, I have stuck in a &quot;dummy&quot; picture that tells you what it
currently is for. Those that say &quot;reserved&quot; mean we haven't decided what to fill
them with yet. This is the way it works:</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>A whole animation 'frame' is defined by a letter. A is frame 1, B is
frame 2, etc. the numbers define the direction at which you are looking at the sprite:</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>1 = Forward</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>2 = Forward-left</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>3 = Left Side</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>4 = Back-left</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>5 = Back</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>6 = Back-right</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>7 = Right Side</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>8 = Forward-right</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><img src="spr2.gif" width="605" height="422" alt="spr2.gif (16239 bytes)"></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>The numbers can be combined so that it &quot;mirrors&quot; another,
such as PLAYA2A8.... The frame will be displayed as it looks for 2, and it will mirror
itself for the 8.</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>To center the sprite in a frame, hit the little green man icon near
the &quot;apply&quot; button.(Then make sure you press APPLY to keep the changes!) This
sets the ground state. You always want to have your character's feet about 5 pixels below
the crosshairs.</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>To import a BMP, select the frame you want, and go to Edit/Load Entry
from File...&nbsp; The <strong>BMP MUST BE 256 COLORS</strong>! If you use a 16-bit or
24-bit image, the program will try to convert it to 256 colors but it won't work.. the
result will be a very stangely colored image.</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>For multiplayer, each person gets to choose the color of themselves
to be put on a &quot;Team&quot;. Teams are either defined as all having the same
character, or all having the same color. The changeable color is &quot;GREEN&quot;. That's
why Sonic above is green, so you can choose your player color.</big></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><img src="spr3.gif" width="640" height="480" alt="spr3.gif (102736 bytes)"></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><big>Once you're all done, rename the PLAY to something else, usually the
first four letters of your character's name (like MACHA3A7, etc.). There is an additional
text file that needs to be inserted, but you can leave that to us for now. <a
href="mailto:ah518@tcnet.org">E-mail your completed character</a> , tell us the name, and
we'll finish it up. If we really like it, you might even see it in some development shots!</big></p>
