	<!-- Please read -->

Please read the following rules and regulations before proceeding to the message board.</P>
<P>

	<!-- MB Rules and Regulations -->

1. Treat others as you would expect them to treat you. Nobody likes to be verbally attacked.
If you want to flame someone, do it elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
2. Try not to post off-topic messages frequently. By all means, the occasional bit of fun
or interesting discussion is acceptable.<BR>
<BR>
3. This board is not a place for you to vent your feelings on Sega vs. Nintendo vs. Sony (vs. Microsoft).
If you want a format war, find a dedicated message board.<BR>
<BR>
4. Keep profanity to a minimum. While the occasional use of "colourful" language is acceptable,
more excessive use is likely to offend some of the messageboard visitors. If the only way
you can express your view is through swearing, then evidently you didn't have much of a point
to begin with.<BR>
<BR>
5. No spam. The occasional message to announce your recently-created "SRB 2 Level" or self-made game
is acceptable. However, when one of the moderators, or administrators, considers your posting
to be beyond the tolerable limit, action will be taken.<BR>
<BR>
6. EzBoard frequently upgrades its services, to enhance the forums. However, on occasion,
these upgrades can cause the messageboard to malfunction in some bizarre ways. If you
experience any difficulties, DO NOT contact us about it - chances are, we already know, and
EzBoard (usually) puts a warning/notice on the messageboard as it is.<BR>
<BR>
7. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of people using more complex HTML in
their custom signatures. While STJr does not condone the use of these, we must ask that,
when writing HTML signatures, you do not use any code which alters the appearance of the
forum page itself. Such examples would be changing the background color of the page from
white to another colour or a picture, or manipulating the title of the page.<BR>
<BR>
These rules and regulations are enforced at all times. Minor offences will result in a warning.
More notable offences will result in messages being deleted. If you continue to commit
violations of these rules, you will be given a 24-hour ban. If, after all this, you still
decide to break the rules of this messageboard, you will be banned completely from the service.
<B>You have been warned.</B><BR>
<BR>
In the case of rule #7, if disobeyed, the messages concerned will be edited, and the
custom signatures disabled. A warning will also be sent to the message author. If this
rule is continually disobeyed, offending messages will simply be deleted, with no further
warning given.<BR>
<BR>
The STJr Message Board moderators are listed at the top of the forum. EzBoard provides us
with the IP address of each poster.<BR>
<BR>
This board is maintained by Sonikku (Founder) and DJ Mike (Administrator).<BR>
<BR>
By proceeding to the messageboard, you are stating that agree to each and every one of these
terms and conditions.<BR>
