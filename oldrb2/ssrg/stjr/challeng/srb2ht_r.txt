Rules -
 
1. To enter the competition, you must beat the Sonic Robo Blast II: Haloween Test level as quickly as possible and send in a demo to prove it, to do this, go to the DOS Prompt and go to your SRB2 folder and run 'recween.bat', which will record a demo of the level. To stop recording, when you beat the level (at the score screen after you cross the finish post), after the score-countup screen, quit the game. To test and see if your demo came out, run the following in the DOS Prompt in your SRB2:HT folder:
 
srb2ween.exe -playdemo mydemo

Please make only ONE run of the level - if you make a mistake, do NOT use 'New game' to restart - see Rule #4 below.
 
When you're satisfied with your entry, send it to johnny@sonikku.freeserve.co.uk
 
2. If you have made an improved time, you may re-submit your entry to the addresses given above.
 
3. You may no use any of the cheat codes (including modifying the config.sys file and changing the gravity level or other console commands to your advantage.) - use your own skill!

4. PLEASE only record one run on the .lmp (i.e, no using the 'New Game' option to restart) - if you make a mistake, quit the game and re-run recween.bat, anyone doing this will have their entry IGNORED ENTIRELY!

5. As a tie-breaker, if two players get the same time, the winner is determined by the highest Kills / Secrets / Items score.

6. As we have uploaded demos, don't 'rip' other peoples demos, i.e, download them and claim them to be 'yours'.

7. Please state whether or not you'd like us to upload your demo!

8. Good luck!
