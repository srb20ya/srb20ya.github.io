<P><B>14th October 1999</B></P>

<P>
Happy Dreamcast Day if you live in
England! Today is the day that the Dreamcast is released around Europe, and
I've got mine already! I'll be posting a less technical breakdown and review
when I've finished playing Sonic Adventure this weekend.<BR>
<BR>
Now, I suppose I should owe everyone who's been wondering 'When's Ku gonna update the Updates section?' an apology - I almost canned this section for the White Glove Diaries, but that section's now devoted more to how the game was made. I'm back, with a new .htm version so you don't have to keep saving all the updates to your PC or continually scroll across anymore! Yay!<BR>
<BR>
<I>So, how's Sonic Robo Blast II been going for the past two months or so without an update to this area?</I> You're probably saying? It's going very well. We've got a new programmer, Merlix to help us program SRB2 now!<BR>
<BR>
We'll be releasing commercials around various sites as time goes on. We've got four commercials in line, which will probably last from about 20 seconds to a minute. Expect similar humour to that seen in 'Pokemon Soccer' and 'A Pocket Lapse'. Or perhaps not.<BR>
<BR>
I also got my first taste of what the SRB2 Soundtrack might sound like about two weeks ago - It's rather splendid. Some might even say it's fudging (This update is 'G' rated for family viewing!) amazing! A big 'Well-done' in order for our musicians and A.J Freda for putting it all together!<BR>
<BR>
OK, I think I'm done now, so you can wake up now and rejoice as the Updates section is back!<BR>
</P>

<P><B>28th December 1999</B></P>

<P>
Wow. Once again, I've let the dust settle on the updates page... another two flippin' months ignoring it - although most of the updates are now done via the message board, the White Glove Diaries and exploding chickens. OK, maybe not the last one then.<BR>
<BR>
So - over the past two months, what happened to SRB2? Well, we've released two test versions, the latter of which has caused a vast amount of confusion. Let's do a quick time warp! Back on 31st October, we released SRB2: Haloween Test, which was a simple 25% (yes, I DID miscalculate the progress by quite a lot) one-level demo which A.J released while I was 'dead'. Most people liked it, I think, but some just said nothing.<BR>
<BR>
The reaction from the Sonic fans was good on the whole, though... with someone giving SRB2:XMAS an A+++++ or something! (=D) However, there were those who didn't like it.<BR>
<BR>
Stealth and Rocket are taking over programming. With a heap of bug fixes planned, and some already done, you can expect the 'official' v 1.0 to be out, meaning it'll be time for some people to re-write a few reviews. =D<BR>
<BR>
So, what have we got so far then? Well, we've still got a lot of stuff to do... this is the more 'minor' stuff as far as programming goes.<BR>
<BR>
<B> * Fix the camera and make it controllable.</B><BR>
<B> * More 'Sonic Adventure-style' friction control.</B><BR>
<B> * Fix some player/badnik problems.</B><BR>
<B> * Proper Sonic-style control (if player press left, Sonic turns AND moves left).</B><BR>
<B> * Put more linedef specials in, such as 'pushers'.</B><BR>
<B> * Possibly give Sonic a spindash.</B><BR>
<BR>
And the major stuff...<BR>
<BR>
<B> * Add Tails + Knuckles.</B><BR>
<B> * All enemy / boss AI.</B><BR>
<B> * Grading.</B><BR>
<B> * Multiplayer - CTF.</B><BR>
<B> * Multiplayer - Race.</B><BR>
<B> * Multiplayer - Survival.</B><BR>
<BR>
So, 35% is about right then...? 30-42% seems to be about the completed mark, as we've got a good 85% of the textures done, and almost all the single player levels complete, with Multiplayer levels in the works.<BR>
<BR>
Please don't think that SRB2-final will be anything like XMAS - we just released this as a larger scale beta-test... and the reaction seemed to be OK on the whole, but we now have a much, much better idea of where to go... it'd have been nicer to have a more complete SRB2:XMAS though... Until two months, then... ;-D<BR>
</P>

<P><B>3rd January 2000</B></P>

<P>
YAY! Time to party! We safely got through 2000 without (as loads of people predicted) the world ending, The so-called 'Millenium Bug' doing much damage (Winzip has decided to display 'bad date' now, however, whenever I open it.) or the landing of the GigaDoomRobots or the sheep of death. Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
If you've recovered from your hangover, SRB2 work is going along quicker than anyone expected! We've improved friction, and we're debating whether the Air Spin Attack should home in (a la
Sonic Adventure)<BR>
<BR>
Don't even think about asking for release dates for SRB2:XMAS v1.0 though. =P<BR>
</P>

<P><B>5th January 2000</B></P>

<P>
Because of the earlier stuff with SRB2:XMAS, A.J is taking a vacation and lying low. Stealth however, is moving on very quickly indeed.<BR>
<BR>
And I decided to ditch the .txt updates, I don't think anyone bothered with them after the release of the .htm version, so it's pretty pointless continuing them!<BR>
</P>

<P><B>6th January 2000</B></P>

<P>
I guess this is more of an announcement than an update. But for the sake of saying this is an 'update', we've got some more work done on the code, and the rings twinkle when you pick them up, like they do in the Sonic games.<BR>
<BR>
Now for the highlight of this update, the SRB2 Mod Archives are coming!<BR>
<BR>
<B> * When?</B> - 2/2/2000.<BR>
<B> * Where?</B> - <a href="http://stjr.segasonic.net">http://stjr.segasonic.net</a><BR>
<B> * What is it?</B> - It will be the ultimate storage of all the SRB2 mods, from levels, to skins and new sounds and graphics, with reviews of the mods and more...</B><BR>
<BR>
It's a month away, and it's a long wait, but it'll give us time to prepare - be sure to send in your bonus levels!<BR>
</P>

<P><B>15th January 2000</B></P>

<P>
Not much to report, we've got a lead on fixing SIGSEGV, and Stealth is now staying on with the team until all of his work on programming is completed, previously, he planned to finish v1.0 of SRB2:XMAS, then work on Mettrix, before returning to STJr to finish off SRB2.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>26th January 2000</B></P>

<P>
At last! SIGSEGV has finally been tracked down, and will soon be gone forever! This will soon be the 'official' release, v0.92. Because of this fix, levels will now NOT crash with SIGSEGV! It will be officially launched to the STJr site, with a patch for those who got the 'unofficial' release as soon as possible!<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, I couldn't work on the Millennial level while this is happening, but I'll try and get it done by 2/2/2000 with the launch of the SRB2 Mod Archives, no guarentees though (stupid schoolwork gets in the way of everything important! ;-D)<BR>
</P>

<P><B>3rd March 2000</B></P>

<P>
I'm starting to get worryingly good at failing to update this file, however frankly, with the Message Board running 24/7 with SRB2 news coming in thick and fast, by the time something reaches this file it's all old, old news.<BR>
<BR>
So! In the meantime, for those of you who have trusted on this file to keep you up to date (uh, sorry!) - then here's the scoop, SRB2:XMAS 0.92 is out, and though SIGSEGV hasn't been totally eradicated, it's certaintely hiding under a more sizable boulder now, though it sometimes pops out to annoy the heck out of you!<BR>
<BR>
There's a bunch of new technology too - TVs, HOMING Spin Attack and Rolling, but some of it is incomplete. Which brings us onto a much less happier note...<BR>
<BR>
Stealth has decided to leave, in my opinion, a little too quickly and convientely after we gave him the $40 money - he was abusive to the other staff members, and ended up saying he couldn't work with us and left. I was worried this would happen (which explains why he only got $40 (£25) instead of the full $80 (£50) which means more money for the SRB2 Prize Fund I guess.<BR>
<BR>
If he wanted to take the money, that was his choice, but in the long run, his reputation will be tarnished, especially as far as his other money making plans are going (IRC 'C' classes, etc.) - but I thought it was a shame that this happened... that's just the start of what I think though, check out what  the rest of the STJr community thought on the message board.<BR>
<BR>
Leaving that behind us, we move on - Rocket is still loyal and programming (though with A.J being a little too helpful at times...), while AJ works on the sprites (or he should be, but then decide to go off and does some programming instead! ;-D), the rest of the team seem happy enough, so work is going on quite smoothly. Version 0.93 should be out soon!<BR>
<BR>
More's been addded to the Mod Archives! The first ever official bonus level and the first ever third-party level! The official level was going to be the prize for entering the contest in the upcoming Time Attack contest, but AJ uploaded it. Argh! This means delay while I churn out another level. KinkaJoy's level is worthy of note, with the only flaw being that the title is a little... well... non-existant. <BR>
<BR>
Expect the next update in a couple of months. =P, or alternatively, check out the message board, where everyone is happy!<BR>
<BR>
Except me, and Stealth apparentely. ;-)<BR>
</P>

<P><B>12th March 2000</B></P>

<P>
Look! An update! In less than two months, nay, WEEKS!.<BR>
<BR>
OK, enough sarcasm. SRB2:XMAS v0.93 is coming soon, featuring another load of extra features, and the XMAS theme is better than than an SRB2:Easter TEST. ;-D - Here's what you should be expecting to see in the next version.<BR>
<BR>
<B> * SCORE / RINGS / TIME</B> instead of just 'RINGS' - that's right, now you can get high scores in the game, which will be uploaded to the page, so if you want to get that 50,000 point time bonus up on the site, now is the time to get practising. ;-), this also leads us up to the tally-up screen between levels, now you can get TIME BONUSes and RING BONUSes, instead of ROBOTS/ITEMS/SECRETS as in the two previous versions.<BR>
<BR>
<B> * Lives and continues</B> have been added to the game, depending on what skill level you choose, the  number of lives and continues you get will be varied.<BR>
<B> * You can now drown!</B> Don't stay underwater too long, or you might regret it...<BR>
<B> * Extra life TVs</B> have been added (no character faces, though, just a TV saying '1Up'.)<BR>
<B> * You can now play as Tails!</B> He can even fly and swim, but the character select screen hasn't been incorporated, so you have to select him from the 'Skins' menu.<BR>
<B> * Multiplayer gaming works!</B> You can now play co-operatively over a LAN, Serial Port, Modem or the Internet!<BR>
<B> * Friction has been greatly improved</B> to avoid sliding around after jumping.<BR>
<B> * Temporary invulnerability</B> after being hit (no more 'one hit deaths', a la Sonic 1)<BR>
* If you're playing on <B>Cakewalk</B> and fall into a deep pit (black floors), you'll be <B>thrown out of the pit</B>!<BR>
* If, however, you're playing on <B>Very Hard</B>, you'll get NO RINGS, One life and no continues! On top of this,
robots are faster, more intelligent and automatically rebuilt after a few
seconds. Arghhh!<BR>
<BR>
So there's a lot to look out for in the new version, plus with my new computer just 3 days away, a CD version will be in the works! Expect extra goodies, such as bonus pre-production artwork, levels, making ofs, and more! Maybe I ought to give it away in the next contest... ;-)<BR>
</P>

<P><B>14th March 2000</B></P>

<P>
...Am I noticing a pattern here? An update in two months, then weeks, then days... freaky!<BR>
<BR>
SRB2:XMAS v0.93 is coming along very quickly, and ALL of the features mentioned above have been programmed in!<BR>
<BR>
I've still not mentioned everything that'll be in the new version, but that's a pretty good indication as what you'll see. I'm even considering putting a hidden character in...<BR>
</P>

<P><B>28th June 2000</B></P>

<P>
Some pattern that was! Bah. Anyway, hello. We're back.<BR>
<BR>
OK, sorry weve been away for ages. But weve done a load on SRB2, so dont worry. First an announcement: I think its safe to say that SRB2:XMAS CD will be the final version of the XMAS series. Firstly, its a good six months since Christmas and secondly, it represents very little of what the final thing will look like. It was originally just intended as a technology test and it was taken too far.<BR>
<BR>
Basically, what weve done since last time:<BR>
<BR>
<B> * True multi-floors.</B> That's right, thanks to the new version of <B><a href="http://www.newdoom.com/doomlegacy">DooM Legacy</a></B>, you can have TRUE floor over floors. Bet you never thought you'd see the DooM engine do that, eh? (Then again, most of you probably thought you couldn't make a platform game out of DooM...)<BR>
<B> * Diagonal springs.</B><BR>
<B> * Fixed underwter music coding.</B> About 99.5% perfect. ;-)<BR>
<B> * New Crawla designs introduced.</B><BR>
<B> * GFZ1 has been redone and is a lot larger.</B> All of the single player levels are due for a new design, on the whole to make the game more open.<BR>
<BR>
We're considering putting up a demo for the upcoming SAGE (Sonic Amateur Games Expo) show, but it's not 100% confirmed)

<P><B>30th September 2000</B></P>

<P>
Back once again with the update masta. Dee-four damage and... uhm, hello!<BR>
<BR>
OK, firstly - I have an excuse for not updating for months! Mike's been working on the new design, meaning I got to take a vaca.. uh, 'chance to reflect upon things'. =D.<BR>
<BR>
Seriously - SRB2 progress has taken another large leap. Right now, programming is slowing up a little while we prepare for the next version of <a href="http://www.newdoom.com/doomlegacy">DooM Legacy</a>, but otherwise, things are going well, with spritework coming along nicely and the site being renovated by DJ Mike.<BR>
<BR>
The updates page got a 'renovation' of sorts - it now gets rid of the completely useless code that MS Word decided to put it, Hurray!!<BR>
<BR>
We did appear at SAGE (see the end of the previous update) and I'm really glad we could produce something for it. You can count on seeing us again in six months!<BR>
<BR>
Also new is the completion of SRB2:XMAS v0.96 - AKA: SRB2:XMAS CD! The winners of the Time Attack contest held earlier this year will get their hands on a copy, along with a few select people for promotional material. Basically, it's most of the current technology applied to SRB2:XMAS with a few nifty levels.<BR>
<BR>
Want a copy? Well, check out the <a href="http://stjr.emulationzone.org">Main Site</a> and see if you're hit 35,000. If so, send us a screenshot!<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, we're still alive, and hopefully we'll have a new update soon... ish. =)<BR>
</P>

<P><B>27th October 2000</B></P>

<P>
See! There is some more consistency in the updates. Sort of a monthly status report, I guess.<BR>
<BR>
Good news: Sonic's sprite is almost complete! A.J Freda sent me the latest WAD of his work on the sprite and I was really happy with what he's got done. Goodbye, Sonic Extreme sprites!<BR>
<BR>
Next on the agenda: The Tails sprite, which is also getting more and more complete. After we've got these sprites out of the way, that'll be the largest chunk of development done and dusted!<BR>
<BR>
Also, expect a little surprise from us soon...<BR>
</P>

<P><B>3rd November 2000</B></P>

<P>
That surprise I mentioned has been released! Though it's hardly an evolution as far as the main engine goes, Sonic Robo Blast 2 : Halloween Test v1.32 is out! The only big difference here is the Windows version, offering bug fixes and higher resolutions as well as Netplay support.<BR>
<BR>
We're currently rewriting the SRB2 code. What does this mean? Well, it means an end to all the various little bugs that have been popping around SRB2. It also means that we can now build a Windows version and Netplay works under the SRB2 engine now! I've tested it with A.J Freda, and while we've recently been having bad connection days and the code re-write isn't complete, it's still a great indication of progress (and a lot of fun, for that matter!)<BR>
</P>

<P><B>13th November 2000</B></P>

<P>
Well, with Demo 1 out, we've found a few bugs in the game here and there. I'll probably get round to adding an FAQ update sooner or later, but reaction towards the demo is extremerly positive and is a real encouragement for us!<BR>
<BR>
Not all that much to report, asides our efforts to fix these bugs, we're experimenting with a few new ideas for exiting levels, considering eliminating the 10 minute time limit and the coding's close to getting finished.<BR>
<BR>
...Mind you, we said THAT last year and look how much we've improved. ;-)
</P>

<P><B>26th January 2001</B></P>

<P>
Once again, this file gets neglected; poor thing. Well, since Demo 1, you can look forward to the below and then some:<BR>
<BR>
<B> * - </B> Greenflower Zone Acts 1, 2 and 3 and Techno Hill Zone Act 1. <BR>
<B> * - </B> Sonic's sprite is completed! No more 'jerky' frames! <BR>
<B> * - </B> Moving platforms.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Players will now spindash if he is moving very slowly, rather than having a strange spasm if you tell him to spin.<BR>
<B> * - </B> All new title screen sequence and menus.<BR>
<B> * - </B> New cheat codes, including the return of 'The Ultimate Cheat' and Sonikku's love interest! =)<BR>
<B> * - </B> Tails is playable, although his sprite is incomplete.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Armageddon Shield is now activated by jumping in the air and pressing the 'spin' button, rather than double-jumping.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Armageddon Shield automatically detonates if the player is hit.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Dr. Eggman's AI has been toned down a little to make him an easier first boss.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Water currents have been introduced - be careful not to get swept away!<BR>
<B> * - </B> The game's speed has been improved, making it more playable to those with reasonably 'low-spec' machines.<BR>
<B> * - </B> ...And some more stuff we're not going to tell you about - we don't want to spoil all the surprises!<BR>
<BR>
So - check out SAGE on the 9th March 2001 and get the second demo. I think you'll all be suitably impressed.
</P>

<P><B>29th May 2001</B></P>

<P>
There's been little point in updating, as all we'd say is "Today we added this new feature." Instead, here's a bulk list of things to expect in Demo 3.<BR>
<BR>
Before we start, I should point out that this update is HEAVILY geared for multiplayer enhancements, as far as single-play is concerned, there have only been a few bug fixes (although the new front-end will be suitably pleasant). Here's what to expect:
<BR>
<B> * - </B> New frontend. This will focus on being the main menu now.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Tails' sprite is now completed. No more 'changing to Sonic'! <BR>
<B> * - </B> Ending of Techno Hill Zone 1 has been redone. The temporary stupid fan bit at the end has been removed and replaced with something far superior.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Multiplayer! Two new multiplayer modes added. See below.<BR>
<B> * - </B> 'Race Mode' - Remember Sonic 2? Relive those times and run through the levels trying to grab as many rings, item boxes and points as possible!<BR>
<B> * - </B> 'Tag Mode' - For those of you who tried out the 'SMATCH' mini-beta tests we held at the SRB2 parties, this will be familiar to you. Basically, tag each other using rings!<BR>
<B> * - </B> New multiplayer maps for the above modes.<BR>
<B> * - </B> A few bug fixes and level improvements (you will no longer get stuck in the lake outside the 'Crawla Pen', for example).<BR>
<B> * - </B> Rings are now spilled properly, rather than randomly.<BR>
<B> * - </B> A few other things we're hiding, as usual.<BR>
<BR>
This demo is expected somewhere around mid or late June.
</P>

<P><B>25th July 2001</B></P>

<P>
A quick update of what to expect for Demo 4, due out on September 9th (SAGE day).<BR>
<BR>
<B> * - </B> Capture the Flag mode! Get onto one of two teams and attempt to capture the other player's flag. This mode will obviously come with special maps for Capture the Flag play.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Special Stages - Get all the rings within a time limit to recieve a Chaos Emerald. The 'Chaos Emeralds' in Demo 3 and below will be replaced with special stage tokens instead.<BR>
<B> * - </B> New robots! Meet Jet-Synn and Deton, among others! (TBC)<BR>
<B> * - </B> There may be one or two extra 'Demo 4 special' single-player levels, however, don't be suprised if they don't turn up.<BR>
<B> * - </B> Big fixes in the launcher program. A few minor glitches have been corrected.<BR>
<B> * - </B> A few multiplayer fixes (the score tally not working correctly in Race mode, for example).<BR>
<B> * - </B> Surprises, yada yada blah blah.<BR>
<BR>
We're not sure if Diving mode will make it into this version or not. Let's hope it does! =)
