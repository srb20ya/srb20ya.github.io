Happy Dreamcast Day if you live in England! Today is the day that the Dreamcast is released around Europe, and I've got mine already! I'll be posting a less technical breakdown and review when I've finished playing Sonic Adventure this weekend.<BR>
<BR>
Now, I suppose I should owe everyone who's been wondering 'When's Ku gonna update the Updates section?' an apology - I almost canned this section for the White Glove Diaries, but that section's now devoted more to how the game was made. I'm back, with a new .htm version so you don't have to keep saving all the updates to your PC or continually scroll across anymore! Yay!<BR>
<BR>
Not much has really happened on S:EQ-RPG... this doesn't mean we've canned it. No way. A lot of you are asking when S:EQ will be done. Erf. No thanks, we're not going to be done with this game for a while. We're not even going to THINK ABOUT starting devolopment for it until everyone's had a 2/3 month rest with SRB2.<BR>
<BR>
Doesn't mean I'll still be doing design work though. OK, so far I've only got Sonic's quest written out - But it's large, we're hoping to try and get each quest to last for 15 hours plus... not to mention the multiple endings we've got in line, and loads of secrets...<BR>
<BR>
More news when it comes.</p>

Wow. Once again, I've let the dust settle on the updates page... another two flippin' months ignoring it - although most of the updates are now done via the message board, the White Glove Diaries and exploding chickens. OK, maybe not the last one then.<BR>
<BR>
There's not been very much in the way of S:EQ-RPG... I've been thinking over the engine and some multiplayer ideas, but that would mean a massive script re-write, which I will have to do, but not just yet... I'll be releasing more and more 'teasers' on the S:EQ-RPG page as time goes on...<BR>
<BR>
Small update, but S:EQ-RPG still exists folks!<BR>

Boy, is the file empty.<BR>
<BR>
Nope, S:EQ-RPG is not dead. Far from it - Jarel Jones has already got at least fifteen or so music tracks done for the game, so we are actually making development progress. Again, we're just concentrating more on SRB2 for now. The game is NOT canned. That's basically the main theme of this update.<BR>
