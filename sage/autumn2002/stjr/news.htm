Resident multiplayer and special stage maker guy Mystic has created an Addons page for
SRB2. There you can get extra levels, characters, and all that good stuff.</font></p>

Alright, that's it. I've put up with it long enough. Please go <a
href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/">HERE</a> and scan for e-mail worms on your
computer. I get flooded with these things every day. Some have text taken out of the SRB2
Readme file, so I know it's gotta be some of you guys.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#ffffff" size="2">I've added a contact page, and legal
info.</font></p>

Sorry about the downtime yesterday - there was a server move taking place. All is well
now!</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#ffffff" size="2">Progress on SRB2 is coming along well, at
least on the programming side. A lot of work is being done in the code to enhance custom
characters and add new features for levels.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#ffffff" size="2">Still accepting texture artist
applications.....</font></p>

What, an update? Get away! YOU SMELL LIKE FEET!</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#ffffff" size="2">Ermm.. anyways, STJr is in *dire* need of
a 2d texture artist. To apply, just click that little link on the left menu to e-mail me.
Include a sample of your work. We're shooting for Sonic 1/2/CD type stuff. Go nuts.
Guidelines/etc will be explained to the 'chosen', as I don't want to bother throwing up a
'terms of employment' page of sorts. (It's late.)</font></p>

To end the mass confusion, I've decided to pack v4.35 up so you don't have to worry about
the confusing patching instructions.</font></p>

It's been awhile since a new patch for 4.32 has been released, so I've done so on the <a
href="432bugs.htm">4.32 Bug Report</a> page. It's a godsend for those of you that play
netgames, since in-game joining SHOULD be fixed now (let me know if it isn't, heh).</p>

SAGE is here, and we have a bit of a treat!</p>

<p>The winner of the website redesign contest is SONIC LIGHTSPEED! Congratulations! You'll
find a load of old maps in your mailbox. =) The other contestants will get something as
well for their hard work.</p>

<p>Because we've just ported SRB2 to the new <a href="http://legacy.newdoom.com">Doom
Legacy v1.32</a> , we need help testing for bugs and stuff that was missed. Visit the
downloads section for a patch to upgrade from Demo 4.1 to 4.32!</p>

<p>Just a short list of the many things new -</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * No more crashing
in hi-res mode!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Better netplay -
including the ability to search for games!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Lots of additions
for level designers, including better handling of missing textures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * OpenGL mode (See
the readme on how to activate it)!</p>

<p>*** Before reporting a bug found, please see the <a href="432bugs.htm">4.32 Bug Report</a>
page! ***</p>

What could have been.....</p>

<p>Back in June 2001, we were notified that Sonic Robo Blast 2 was to be featured in
GameGo! Magazine's issue #3. Unfortunately it never got past issue #1, but I was able to
get ahold of a PDF of issue #2 in its entirety, and they have a <a href="gamego.png">little
blurb on SRB2 near the back.</a></p>
