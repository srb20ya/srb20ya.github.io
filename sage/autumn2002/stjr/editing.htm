<p>So, you want to edit SRB2, eh?</p>

<p>While we don't have time to write up nice fancy tutorials (at least *I* don't, heh),
here you can find ample documentation on modifying SRB2. I assume that you already know
how to use <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/classicdoom/utils/editors.php">Doom editing
utilities</a>. If you don't, <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/tutorials/index.shtml">here's
some tutorials to get you started</a>. If you know how to modify Doom, you're already
halfway there.</p>

<p>You can use any tools you want, but here's the ones I use, and will reference in this
document:</p>

<p>Wintex 4.3</p>

<p>DCK v3.62</p>

<p>NWT v1.3</p>

<p>Zennode&nbsp; 1.0.8</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lots of people prefer to use WadAuthor since it doesn't need to be run in pure DOS, but
I personally don't recommend it. If you do use it, make sure to use Zennode to build the
nodes, and not WadAuthor's internal nodesbuilder.</p>

<p>This page is split up into sections, each separated by one of these checkered Sonic bar
things:</p>

<p><img src="bar2.gif" width="408" height="25"></p>

<p>The order is as follows:</p>

<p><em><strong>LEVEL EDITING</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>CUSTOM CHARACTERS</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>MUSIC</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>SRB2 CONFIGURATION FILES FOR UTILITIES</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>HELP</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>CORRECTIONS</strong></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I'm absolutely crap with HTML, you'll have to scroll down to the section you want
and keep your eyes peeled for one of the bars.</p>

<p>Here we go!</p>

<p><img src="bar1.gif" width="408" height="25"></p>

<p></font><font face="verdana" color="ffffff" size="6"><strong>LEVEL EDITING</strong></font><font
face="verdana" size="2" color="ffffff"></p>

<p>All your basic sector creation, linedefs, etc. are all identical to Doom. There are a
few extra things you have to watch out for, though:</p>

<p>* Avoid creating any IMPASSABLE linedefs that the player will come in contact with.
Instead of using an impassable line, create a sector at least 60 units in width, and set
its floor and ceiling heights to the same value.</p>

<p>* Don't use any walk, button, or shoot line triggers (WR, W1, SR, S1, DR, D1, etc.), as
SRB2 does not utilize these. In fact, no line triggers are used whatsoever. Any special
triggering is done by use of sector specials.</p>

<p>* I'll add more &quot;Don't&quot;s here when I think of them!</p>

<p>More information on level editing to come!</p>

<p></font><font face="verdana" color="ffffff" size="6"><strong>CUSTOM CHARACTERS</strong></font><font
face="verdana" size="2" color="ffffff"></p>

<p>Yup, you can make your own characters to guide through SRB2! But you probably knew
that. Anyway, this section covers absolutely everything you'd ever want to know about
making your own character to use against your buddies.</p>

<p></font><font face="verdana" color="#FF0000" size="3"><em>Warning! This section is
constantly changing and some things may be COMPLETELY different in the future! Keep up to
date with this page to make sure your character works with the latest SRB2 version!</em></font><font
face="verdana" size="2" color="ffffff"></p>

<p>With that out of the way, let's begin!</p>

<p>Animations within a WAD file are named using four letters, for example, the default
player is PLAY. The four other letters after it define the frame number and angle(s) it
should be shown.</p>

<p>Letters are used to denote the frame number, and numeric digits (0-8) are used to
define the angle.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>PLAYA1 - First frame, shown at angle 1 (front view)</p>

<p>FLWRC0 - Third frame, show it for all angles (0 means show this sprite no matter what
angle it is being looked at)</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Note: </em>The entries actually start at ASCII character 60 (A) and go forward.
Wintex only supports capital letters, limiting you to a total of 32 frames (up to `). SRB2
goes beyond this (currently uses 33), and Wintex will ruin a wad if you save it without
taking the right precautions. Don't blame us, it's these dirt-old utilities we've gotta
put up with. =P</p>

<p>Before saving your file, rename any of the would-be lowercase entries at the end to
something else that you can easily distinguish. For example, I'll rename:</p>

<p>KNUXa2a8</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>KNUKa2a8</p>

<p>(Note that Wintex will display the lowercase entires with a capital letter - which
means you'll have a KNUXA2A8 at the beginning of your file and KNUXA2A8 near the end. The
one near the end is the lowercase one.)</p>

<p>After saving with Wintex, it will convert it to KNUKA2A8. Next, crack open a Hex
editor. If you cleaned your wad after saving, this will be easy to do. Scroll all the way
down to the end of the file until you see the large list of entry names. You'll find, for
example, KNUKA2A8 at the very end. Change it to KNUXa2a8.</p>

<p>It may sound hard, but it is really quite easy. Once you've done it for the first time,
successive hex editing is painless.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now that you've loaded all of your graphics into the entries and renamed the
four-letter entries to something relevant to your character (i.e., you might name
&quot;Invader Zim&quot; as IZIM), it's time to edit the S_SKIN data lump. This little
tidbit provides information about your character, such as its name &quot;Invader
Zim&quot;, his speed, and abilities that he possesses. Let's not forget life icons and
sounds, too!</p>

<p>S_SKIN is really just a text file, which looks like this:</p>

<p>name = Invader_Zim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;---- Spaces not
allowed!</p>

<p>face = IZIMICON
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;----
32x32 life icon picture (must be 8 characters long)</p>

<p>facename = IZIMNAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;---- Name graphic that appears
above the life icon (must be 8 characters long)</p>

<p>ability = 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;---- Fly like Tails. Perhaps some kind of propeller can come out of his backpack</p>

<p>speed = 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;---- 40% of Sonic's speed. Zim can run, but he's no Sonic character</p>

<p>sprite = IZIM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;---- Optional. Just reiterates which set of sprites to load to make sure the game
doesn't get confused.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's the chart for all possible ability and speed numbers:</p>

<p>Ability<br>
-------<br>
0 = Sonic's Thok<br>
1 = Tails' Fly<br>
2 = Knuckles' Glide<br>
3 = Nothing<br>
<br>
If anything else is specified, it defaults to &quot;Nothing&quot;.<br>
<br>
Speed<br>
-------<br>
0 = Sonic's Speed (100%)<br>
1 = Tails's Speed (60%)<br>
2 = Knuckles's Speed (80%)<br>
3 = 40% Speed<br>
4 = 120% Speed<br>
5 = 20% Speed<br>
<br>
If anything else is specified, it defaults to &quot;20% Speed&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To add custom sounds, you just list the original sound, and then the name of the custom
sound in the WAD you want assigned to it. Here are the ones you can use:</p>

<p>DSSPIN - Sound when Sonic goes into a spin while moving.<br>
DSPUTPUT - Tails flying<br>
DSPUDPUD - Tails tired from flying<br>
DSPLPAIN - Ring spill<br>
DSPLDETH - &quot;Ba-dum!&quot; death sound<br>
DSTHOK - Sound effect used for Sonic's Thok.<br>
DSSPNDSH - Spindash rev<br>
DSZOOM - Spindash release<br>
DSRADIO - Little &quot;ding&quot; when you message a player<br>
DSGASP - Grab a bubble<br>
DSJUMP - Jump!</p>

<p>Note that your new sound MUST ALSO have DS as the first two letters.</p>

<p>So we would continue the text file like so:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>dsspin = dszspin</p>

<p>dsputput = dszput</p>

<p>dspudpud = dszpud</p>

<p>dsplpain = dszpain</p>

<p>dspldeth = dszdeath</p>

<p>dsspndsh = dszdash</p>

<p>dszoom = dszzoom</p>

<p>dsradio = dsztalk</p>

<p>dsgasp = dszgasp</p>

<p>dsjump = dszjump</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice that I didn't replace ALL the sounds. You don't have to. Only replace the ones
you want.</p>

<p>The S_SKIN entry MUST be the FIRST one in your file and come before all of the sprites!</p>

<p>If you did everything right, it should work! (Zim is NOT a finished/downloadable
character, sorry. =))</p>
