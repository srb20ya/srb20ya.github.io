<b>GREENFLOWER ZONE</b>:<br>Considering Eggman's invasion has just started, the zone is relatively free of any robots, but that still doesn't mean you have time to enjoy the lush landscape. Features waterfalls, hidden caves and plenty of fauna.

<b>TECHNO HILL ZONE</b>:<br>This was once a beatiful landscape, but has been mostly tainted by Eggman's chemical factory, pumping out slime. The factory was abandoned after his unsuccessful invasion, but has since come back to life! Watch out for the machines inside the factory, and the chemical dumping which is taking place outside.

<b>DEEP SEA ZONE</b>:<br>Sonic, Tails and Knuckles stumble across some ruins, which have been flooded, partly by nature and partly by Eggman digging away for the Chaos Emeralds. Be wary of water traps which can threaten to drown you!

<b>MINE MAZE ZONE</b>:<br>Following Eggman's trail from the Deep Sea Zone, you come across one of his new mines. Sadly, Eggman is not happy with your presence and the mining robots have turned their attention to you. Watch out for some more unstable parts of the mine and the robots.

<b>ROCKY MOUNTAIN ZONE</b>:<br>Emerging from the mines, you come across a huge mountain. While Sonic must find a way to scale this, Tails and Knuckles can use their abilities to the fullest. Be careful not to enjoy the scenery too much, as there are plenty of falling platforms and obstacles.

<b>RED VOLCANO ZONE</b>:<br>Finding Eggman's robots entering the volcano, you follow them to investigate what's happening. Rather than worrying about Eggman's traps here, you should be more concerned with the deadly lava, that threatens to rise without warning.

<b>DARK CITY ZONE</b>:<br>You've finally reached the heart of Eggman's operations, however the robot denizens are less than pleased to see you. Eggman's security is pretty tight, and will certaintely slow you down as you try to board the Doomship.
